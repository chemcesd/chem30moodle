            <br />
            Previous science courses probably taught you that molecules store chemical potential energy, which can be released when chemical bonds in matter are broken and new bonds are formed. Maybe you’ve even completed an experiment to determine the energy in a sample of food or fuel. Whether oil is crude or plant-based — peanut oil, palm oil, olive oil, or canola oil — it has molecules that are often described as “energy rich.”<br />
            <br />
            Rudolf Diesel, the inventor of the diesel engine, demonstrated in 1900 at the World’s Fair in Paris that an engine could run on peanut oil rather than on petroleum-based fuels.<br />
            <br />
            Considering the current concern over the depletion of crude oil reserves and the growing demand for energy, Diesel was quite a visionary when he mentioned, in 1912, that<br />

            <div id="centertext">Even though the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today, such oils may become in the course of time as important as the petroleum and coal tar products of the present time.</div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Diesel’s insight about the potential of plant-based oils as an energy source is being demonstrated by people using waste vegetable oil from restaurants as a fuel in their vehicles  powered by diesel engines. Around the world, some governments and some corporations within the energy industry are promoting the production of biodiesel, the fuel produced by the modification of vegetable oils.<br />
            <br />
            The yearly consumption of diesel fuel in North America is 245.5 billion litres, most of it for transportation of goods and people. The production and sale of blended diesel fuels, which contain a percentage of biodiesel (e.g., 20% in the case of biodiesel B-20), mixed with petroleum-based diesel fuel is a growing industry in Europe, where sources of petroleum-diesel are limited. Concerns about depleting petroleum sources elsewhere in the world, including North America, have forced governments and the oil industry to consider biodiesel as a means to offset some of the demand for petroleum-diesel.<br />
            <br />
          In this project, you will investigate the production and use of biodiesel, focusing on the chemistry of its production, the practicality of its use at low temperatures, the energy changes associated with its use, and the sustainability of this energy source.
