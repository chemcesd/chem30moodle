<p>Unit A studies the energy  changes that occur in chemical reactions. In this unit you will learn how to measure the  magnitude of such energy changes. You will also explore  scientific theories that are used to predict and explain the energy changes involved  in a chemical change, which are based on empirical measurements similar  to the type you will make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 1 examines how energy  changes in chemical reactions are determined and interpreted. In Science 10 you used calorimetry to investigate energy changes of physical changes.  In this module you will use  calorimetry to measure enthalpy changes. You will use standard molar enthalpies of formation to predict the magnitude of energy changes associated with chemical reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 2 investigates the  events and energy changes associated with chemical reactions from the molecular  level. You will learn about activation energy and the role that catalysts have  to play in chemical processes. You will understand the function of catalysts from  the perspective of chemical energetics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because energy is a unifying  theme throughout this course and in science, these two modules will be an  important foundation for your study throughout this course. For example, in Unit  B you will investigate electrochemical changes and further study energy  conversions when matter undergoes change. Unit C involves an investigation of  hydrocarbons, a common source of energy in society, and petrochemicals.<strong> </strong>Finally,  Unit D involves a study of chemical equilibrium. As you will find, energy  transfers between a chemical system and its surroundings can influence an  equilibrium.  The influence of energy in a chemical system is best exemplified by the many chemical processes that require energy in the form of heat or light in order to occur. </p>

<p>For clear viewing of equations in Microsoft(R) Office Word documents, Euclid fonts are required. You can download them from <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/dl/fonts/getfont.asp" target="_blank">http://www.dessci.com/en/dl/fonts/getfont.asp</a> if you do not already have them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of Unit A you  will be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>determine and interpret energy changes in chemical reactions</li>
  <li>explain and communicate energy changes in chemical reactions</li>
  </ul>
<p>You will showcase what you have learned in the Unit A Assessment.</p>
