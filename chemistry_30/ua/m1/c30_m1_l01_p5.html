<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does society use the energy of chemical changes?</li>
  <li>How do you use the energy of chemical changes in your life?</li>
</ul>
<p>Society uses a variety of energy sources. Greater consideration has
recently been given to the environmental impact of energy use. In this
lesson you learned about a variety of energy sources. These included
chemical potential energy in the food you eat, the fossil fuels used
for many modes of transportation, and solar energy, which is the
ultimate energy source for the biosphere. You learned about the
chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis, cellular respiration,
and combustion; and you learned how these reactions are part of the
carbon cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You also assessed your personal energy intake to get an idea of how
much chemical potential energy your body needs to sustain itself.
