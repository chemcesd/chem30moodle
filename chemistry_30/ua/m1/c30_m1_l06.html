<p>Campfires are a common sight on ecotours. They are a means of
cooking food, providing warmth, and inspiring stories. Fire involves a
combustion reaction&#8212;one of the most common exothermic reactions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a science student you have been taught to observe chemical
reactions for evidence of change, including energy change. What kinds
of energy changes are occurring during a combustion reaction? In some
reactions you can feel an increase in temperature or see light emitted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous lessons you learned to quantify the energy change, as
heat, associated with a chemical reaction. In this lesson you will
further expand your understanding of enthalpy change. You will
investigate how each of the following methods allows a process'
enthalpy change to be clearly identified and associated with a specific
chemical reaction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>molar enthalpy of reaction for a specific reactant</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>enthalpy change for a balanced reaction equation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>inclusion of the energy as a term in a balanced reaction equation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>chemical potential energy diagrams</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete <span class="nowrap">
Lesson 6</span>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How are enthalpy changes communicated?</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no assignment for this lesson. However, you will be asked
to submit samples of your work to your teacher for feedback where
instructed.</p>
