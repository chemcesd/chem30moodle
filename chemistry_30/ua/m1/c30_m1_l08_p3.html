<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 8 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How are standard molar       enthalpies of formation used to determine the enthalpy change associated       with chemical reactions?</li>
</ul>
<p>You  learned about standards and reference points used to study energy  changes. The reference point for standard molar enthalpies of formation  states that the potential energy of elements in their most stable form at SATP is 0 kJ/mol. You also learned how to interpret values for standard molar  enthalpies of formation to assess the thermal stability of compounds. You used  these values much in the same way you used Hess&rsquo; law, to calculate a reaction  enthalpy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>reference  energy state:</strong> a reference point at which the potential energy of the elements in  their most stable form at SATP is defined as zero</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>standard  enthalpy of formation:</strong> the enthalpy change calculated from the measurements of a formation reaction  under standard conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>thermal  stability:</strong> the tendency of a compound to resist decomposition when heated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The  lower a compound's standard enthalpy of formation, the more stable the compound.
