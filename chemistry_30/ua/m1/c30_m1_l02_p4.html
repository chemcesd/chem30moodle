<p>Calorimetric data about the energy content in foods is not always
reliable. Use the Internet to research other methods used to determine
the energy content in foods. Why are other methods used? Do the other
methods have limitations or do they provide greater accuracy than
calorimetric data?</p>

<strong>Practice 1. </strong>
<p><br>
</p>
Answers will vary but may be similar to either of the following
responses:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Energy cannot be created nor destroyed.</li>
  <li>All energy comes from some other form of energy.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<strong> Practice 2. </strong>
<p><br>
</p>
It is assumed that a calorimeter does not transfer energy with its
surroundings. Therefore, a calorimeter is an isolated system.<br>
<br>
<strong>Practice 3. </strong>
<p><br>
</p>
A calorimeter is used to measure the change in the system&#8217;s thermal
energy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Practice 4.</strong>
<p> </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>If the mass of material undergoing temperature change is doubled
and the other variables remain the same, then the thermal energy is
doubled.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If the specific heat capacity of material undergoing temperature
change is divided by two (is halved) and the other variables remain the
same, then the thermal energy is halved.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If the temperature change of the material is tripled and the
other variables remain the same, then the thermal energy is tripled.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If all three variables (<em>m</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>&#916;t</em>)
are doubled, then the thermal energy is increased by a factor of 8 (2
&times; 2 &times; 2 = 8).<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<strong> Practice 5. </strong>
<p><br>
</p>
The values in &#8220;Table 1&#8221; on page 486 in the textbook show that iron has
a lower specific heat capacity than aluminium. Therefore, iron requires
less thermal energy to change temperature by one degree. As a result of
its lower specific heat capacity, a 100-g iron mass would undergo a
greater temperature change than a 100-g aluminium mass if the same
quantity of energy were applied to both samples.<br>

<p>Drake Landing is an innovative neighborhood located in Okotoks,
Alberta. Part of Drake Landing&#8217;s innovation involves the way the
development uses solar energy to greatly reduce the neighbourhood&#8217;s
dependence on fossil fuels. As shown in the picture, energy from the
sun is used to heat homes. This greatly reduces the need for fossil
fuels. </p>

Landing Solar Community</a>&#8221; for more information on how a community
solar heating system works.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solar panels found on the roofs of buildings within the Drake
Landing Solar Community are part of an active solar heating system. The
circulation of antifreeze solution through the system allows for the
transfer of energy from the collector to the house or to the borehole
energy storage system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m1/015_solar_heating.jpg"
 alt="This graphic shows a diagram titled Active Solar Heating System. An outline of a house is shown with a solar heat collector located on the roof. The solar heat collector consists of a layer of high transmittance glass over an absorber sheet with optical coating and copper tubing. Inside the copper tubing is an antifreeze solution. Cool antifreeze solution is pumped from a solar storage tank located inside the house to the collector. Warm antifreeze is pumped from the collector to the solar storage tank. Inside the solar storage tank is a heat exchanger that is connected to a furnace. In the furnace, warm air is released to heat the house."
