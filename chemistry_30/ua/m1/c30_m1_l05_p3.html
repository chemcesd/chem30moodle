<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The molar enthalpy for many chemical reactions can be determined
experimentally, provided you have appropriate equipment. Earlier you
constructed a calorimeter using nested polystyrene cups. In this
investigation you will use a calorimeter to determine the molar
enthalpy change (KJ/mol) for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutralization
reaction</span> between aqueous sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid
solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine the molar heat of a chemical change (reaction), and to
compare the experimentally obtained value with a widely accepted value
for the &#916;<span class="subscript">n</span>H<span class="subscript">m</span>
for sodium hydroxide (-57 KJ/mol).</p>
<strong><br>
Experimental Design</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heat of reaction will be measured by combining <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">30.0 mL</span> of 1.0
mol/L H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>(aq)&nbsp;
with
<span style="font-weight: bold;">50.0 mL</span> of 1.0 mol/L NaOH(aq).
The two reactants will be combined
in a simple calorimeter made of two polystyrene cups nested together. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Assume that the
specific heat capacity of both of these substances is equal to that of
water (4.19 J/g&deg;C), and that each of these solutions has a density
identical to water (1 mL=1 gram).</span></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The procedure that is followed in the virtual lab is listed
below:</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Nest two polystyrene cups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Measure <span style="font-weight: bold;">30.0
mL of 1.0 mol/L</span> H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span
 class="subscript">4</span>(aq)
solution using a 50-mL graduated cylinder and pour it into the
calorimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using another 50-mL graduated cylinder,
measure <span style="font-weight: bold;">50.0 mL of 1.0 mol/L</span>
NaOH(aq) solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Record the temperature of each solution to
the nearest 0.1&deg;C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Pour the NaOH solution into the
calorimeter. Use the third cup as a lid. Insert the thermometer into a
hole in the lid, and slowly stir the mixture with the thermometer.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Note:&nbsp;
When two aqueous solutions are mixed in a calorimeter, the final
aqueous mixture is considered to be the water in the calorimeter when
calculating <span style="font-style: italic;">Q</span>.</span><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Record the highest temperature obtained to
the nearest 0.1&deg;C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Pour the reaction mixture down the sink.
The reaction mixture contains dilute excess sulfuric acid and acqueous
sodium sulfate, and it does not require specific treatment prior to
disposal. Rinse the calorimeter and other glassware used. Put all
equipment away.</p>
