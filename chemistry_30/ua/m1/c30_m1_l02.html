<p>In Lesson 1 you identified your daily energy intake from food. The
food you eat provides you with chemical potential energy to maintain
your body functions and your activity level. Although foods can vary
greatly in the quantity of energy they provide, the energy contained
within all food can be traced back to the sun&#8212;the biosphere&#8217;s ultimate
energy source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In this lesson you will investigate how the energy content of food
is determined and how the principles used to collect energy are applied
to other technologies. You will use what you learn to create a list of
foods to offer the participants in your ecotour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How is energy quantified?</li>
</ul>
