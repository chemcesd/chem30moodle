<h6>Energy Change of a Hot Pack</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you learned about enthalpy change and how an enthalpy
change might be quantified using calorimetry. Complete the following
activity to test your understanding of what you have learned.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<img src="../icons/watch_and_listen.gif" width="35" height="31"> Watch
the video &#8220;<a href="https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/t4tes/courses/senior/chemistry_30/mm/m1/hotpack/hotpack.html" target="_blank">Operation
of a Hot Pack</a>.&#8221;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The following data were collected from a calorimetry experiment
investigating the energy released by the hot pack shown in the video.
Use your observations from watching the video and the data provided to
complete the Analysis section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mass of water in calorimeter = 550 g<br>
initial temperature of water = 22.3&ordm;C<br>
highest temperature of water = 30.7&ordm;C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RC 1. </strong>The contents of the hot pack are listed as
sodium acetate, water, and a metal disk. State the change that occurs
to the arrangement of the sodium acetate particles during the operation
of the hot pack.<br>
<br>
<strong>RC 2.</strong> Is the type of change identified in your answer
to RC 1 an example of a change in kinetic energy or potential energy?
Support your answer.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>RC 3. </strong>Explain why the change identified in your
answer to RC 2 represents an enthalpy change.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>RC 4. </strong>Use the data provided to determine the
enthalpy change of the hot pack.<br>
<br>
<strong>RC 5. </strong>Is the enthalpy change of the hot pack an
exothermic or endothermic process?&nbsp; Support your answer by making
specific reference to the data provided.</p>
