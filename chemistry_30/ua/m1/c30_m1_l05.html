<p>Historically, Inuit living in the Arctic depended primarily on seal
oil prepared from blubber as a fuel source for light, cooking, and
heating. While using seal oil may seem peculiar, it was an ingenious
use of this resource because of the oil&#8217;s high caloric content,
availability, and ease of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most modern societies, factors beyond availability and ease of
use must be considered when choosing fuels. Cost and transportation are
important factors. However, perhaps the most important consideration is
energy richness. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would you define the energy richness of a fuel? Could you
incorporate some of the concepts you learned about in earlier Module 1
lessons to define energy richness? How might you determine the energy
richness of a fuel? In this lesson you will learn how to use enthalpy
changes to assess fuels. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 5:<br>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>How can the energy richness of different fuels be compared?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
