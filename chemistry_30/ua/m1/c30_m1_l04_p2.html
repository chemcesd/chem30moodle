<div class="right2blockA">
  <p><strong>kinetic molecular theory:</strong> a theory that states that small particles  that make up a substance are in continuous motion and collide with each other  and with objects in their path</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>kinetic energy: </strong>a form of energy related to  the motion of particles</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Kinetic  energy can involve vibration, rotation, or translation within or of a particle.  Kinetic energy changes are often observed as a temperature change in matter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>chemical potential  energy:</strong> a stored form of energy dependent on the relative  positions of particles</div>
<p>All matter is made of tiny  particles. The <strong>kinetic molecular theory</strong> states that small particles that make  up a substance are in continuous motion and collide with each other and with objects  in their path. Motion associated with particles can involve more than  collisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read  the bulleted lists under &ldquo;Heat Transfer and Enthalpy Change&rdquo; at the bottom of  page 487 in the textbook to review the kinds of motion that are associated  with a particle&rsquo;s <strong>kinetic energy </strong>and<strong> </strong>the associations between particles  that involve <strong>chemical</strong> <strong>potential energy</strong>.</p>

<div class="right2blockA"><strong>enthalpy</strong>: the total kinetic and potential  energy in a system </div>
<p>The  sum of the kinetic and potential energies in a system is called <strong>enthalpy</strong>. A system&rsquo;s enthalpy cannot be  measured directly but can be determined indirectly by comparing the change in  enthalpy of the products relative to the reactants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 3 you used a calorimeter to measure energy changes that were the result  of changes involving matter. How does the energy change for a process measured  using a calorimeter relate to an enthalpy change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Energy Measured in a Calorimeter </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2. </strong>Write  a paragraph to respond to the question in the Read activity above: how does the energy change for a process measured using a calorimeter relate to   an enthalpy change? Save your  response in your course folder and submit a copy to your teacher. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong>Can you recall any other assumptions that are  made in the design of a calorimeter or in interpreting the data collected from  the calorimeter? How do these assumptions make it possible to measure the enthalpy change of  a process that occurs within a calorimeter? Make sure you save a copy of your answers  to these questions in your course folder as they will help you complete the  next activity.</p>
