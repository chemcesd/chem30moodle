 alt="Three photographs are shown. The fist photograph shows a camp fire. The second photo shows many small lumps of burning coal. The third photo shows an Inuit oil stove, which is a rectangular, black, metal, box-like object containing a liquid oil. Flames appear along one edge of the stove due to a piece of moss resting on the edge. One end of the moss is in the oil, while the other end is on the edge of the stove. A grill sits on top of the flames."

processes. Where does the energy within each fuel come from?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Draw a diagram that traces the energy source
in each of the fuels back to its origin. Save a copy of the diagrams in
your course folder. You may wish to refer to these later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> State two additional ultimate energy sources?</p>

Contact your teacher if your answers vary significantly from the
answers provided here.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 1.</strong> All energy sources originated from biological
sources (wood, coal, and animal fat), meaning that the ultimate source
of energy was the sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Your diagrams should look like the following
(arrows indicate the direction of the flow of energy):</p>
<p><br>
sun &#8594; tree &#8594; firewood <br>
sun &#8594; plant/animal tissue &#8594; coal <br>
sun &#8594; plant life &#8594; fish &#8594; seal oil</p>
<p><br>
Remember to place a copy of these diagrams in your course folder for a
later look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> The other ultimate energy sources include
geothermal energy and gravitational energy.</p>

Compare your answers to SC 1 and SC 2 with what you read in the
textbook. Did you correctly identify the original source of energy for
the three fuels? Modify your answer if you need to, and then place an

<p>What purpose does food have? Although taste is important, food is
all about energy. How much energy do you require to perform your daily
activities? Why are you hungrier after a hike in the mountains than
when you are sitting and watching television? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To perform your daily activities, your body uses <strong>chemical
potential energy</strong> from the food you consume. In previous
science courses you learned that energy is measured in joules. The
energy in food can also be measured in another unit, calories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the &#8220;Personal Use of Chemical Energy&#8221; case study on page 482 of
the textbook. In the case study, you will investigate how you obtain
energy from your diet and how energy intake should be balanced with
activity level and other energy requirements.</p>

<p>Can you imagine having a diet in which you ate only glucose? A
healthy diet contains other foods and energy sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain foods have more chemical potential energy than other foods.
If you examine the diagram of the glucose molecule, you will identify a
number of chemical bonds. The chemical potential energy you obtain from
food is stored in the chemical bonds that hold molecules together. Your
digestive system is designed to break these chemical bonds and to
absorb or convert what you eat into carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
that your body can access when it needs energy. <span
 class="commentEditor"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockA"><strong>carbohydrate:</strong> a carbon
compound that contains many hydroxyl groups and has the general
chemical formula C<span class="subscript">n</span>H<span
 class="subscript">2n</span>O<span class="subscript">n</span> <br>
(e.g., glucose, C<span class="subscript">6</span>H<span
 class="subscript">12</span>O<span class="subscript">6</span>)</div>
<p>Some types of chemical potential energy are easier for your body to
use than others. Simple <strong>carbohydrate</strong> molecules, such
as sugars like glucose, are a quick source of energy for the body
because the molecule's bonds are easy to break. It takes the body
longer to break the bonds in complex carbohydrates, like the starch
found in pasta and whole-grain flour. Because they can provide a source
of energy for a long period of time, complex carbohydrates are better
for high-energy sports with long durations&#8212;hiking and cross-country
skiing, for example.<br>

<p>Hikers and campers use information about different types of food to
make informed choices when they pack for trips. They choose foods that
pack a high-energy bang for the buck. Energy bars, which are a popular
choice for many hikers, often include a mixture of simple and complex
carbohydrate sources. These sources provide the immediate and long-term
energy to support an activity.<br>
