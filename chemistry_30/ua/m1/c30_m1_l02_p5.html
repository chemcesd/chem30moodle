<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How is energy quantified?</li>
</ul>
<p>You learned about  calorimetry, which is an experimental technique used to measure energy  transfers. You used the formula <em>Q</em> = <em>mc&Delta;t</em> to calculate the  energy gain or loss by a system in order to determine the energy content of  foods. You also investigated the design of calorimeters. And you applied your  understanding of the principles of energy transfer to the operation of a solar  collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>calorimeter:</strong> an isolated system in  which the chemical system being studied is surrounded by a known quantity of  liquid</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>calorimetry:</strong> the technological process of measuring the energy changes  of an isolated system</p>
