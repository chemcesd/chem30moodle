<div class="right2blockA"><strong>enthalpy of reaction: </strong>the
change in the energy of a chemical system as it proceeds from reactants
to products</div>
<p>In Lesson 4 you learned about enthalpy change. An enthalpy change
occurs in every chemical reaction due to the change in potential energy
associated with the change in bonding of the atoms involved. The energy
change associated with a chemical reaction is called the <strong>enthalpy
of reaction.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not surprise you that overall energy changes associated with
a reaction depend on the quantity of matter involved. For example, to
get more heat out of your campfire for your ecotour participants, you
would put more wood, or fuel, on the fire. It might surprise you that
enthalpy change is not the same for all combustion reactions. You may
have encountered this when you noticed that some fuels appear to
release more energy than others when they combust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you compare the enthalpy of reaction for different reactions?
Read page 490 and work through &#8220;Sample problem 11.2&#8221; and &#8220;Communication
example 3&#8221; on page 491 in the textbook to find out.</p>

<h6>Molar Enthalpy of Fuel Combustion</h6>
<p><br>
Later in this lesson you will be asked to compare fuels. You will be
given information about the molar enthalpy of reaction for each of the
fuels to be compared. What does this information mean? Can you guess
how a molar enthalpy of reaction for each fuel was determined? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> State the purpose of determining a molar
enthalpy of combustion for different fuels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Describe an experiment that could be used to
determine the molar enthalpy of combustion for a fuel. You may wish to
determine the values you would need to measure during your experiment
and then draft a formula that uses all your measured values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the bottom section of page 491 in the textbook for help
completing your description. <br>

<div class="right2blockA"><strong>molar enthalpy: </strong>a change in
enthalpy of a chemical system <em>per mole</em></div>
<p>The enthalpy of reaction<strong> </strong>is the change in enthalpy
of a chemical system. <strong>Molar enthalpy</strong> is a change in
enthalpy of a chemical system <em>per mole</em>. Molar enthalpy is
helpful when assessing different fuels&#8212;just as &#8220;apples to apples&#8221; are
compared in everyday life, molar enthalpy allows comparing &#8220;moles to
moles&#8221; in chemistry.</p>

A positive value indicates that the process described is an endothermic
process (energy is absorbed by the system when the reaction occurs). A
negative value means that the process is exothermic (energy is released
by the system when the reaction occurs).</p>
