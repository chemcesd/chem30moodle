<h3 class="unitAh3">Module 1&mdash;Thinking Energy</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Personal  Energy Use</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will consider how your body and other biological systems use energy. You will learn about the origin of the  energy in the food you eat. You will review the processes of photosynthesis,  cellular respiration, and the carbon cycle; and you will consider their importance  to the energy sources used by society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following  lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How       does society use the energy of chemical changes? </li>
  <li>How do you       use the energy of chemical changes in your life?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;How Much  Energy?</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the energy content of a food determined? In Lesson 2 you will  use calorimetry to quantify energy associated with a chemical process or a  food. 
  You will use knowledge gained in this lesson to select foods to meet the  energy requirements of clients in your ecotourism company. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate  the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How is energy       quantified?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Specific  Heat Capacity</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you will look at an important thermodynamic property  unique to each substance-specific heat capacity. You will use your knowledge of  specific heat capacity to evaluate materials with respect to their insulating  properties. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate  the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> How can knowledge of  specific heat capacity be used in the design of a sleeping bag? </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Enthalpy  and the Kinetic Molecular Theory</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you will consider the changes in energy that are  associated with chemical change. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What changes occur during a chemical reaction at  the particle level?</li>
  <li>Why do       chemical changes and energy changes occur at the same time?</li>
  <li>What is enthalpy?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Molar  Enthalpy</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you will learn more about enthalpy. You will understand  the importance of knowing the enthalpy  change for a chemical reaction per mole of  reactants involved and how this may be used to evaluate different fuels used  by your ecotourism company. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How can the       energy richness of different fuels be compared?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 6&mdash;Communicating  Enthalpy Change</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you will learn different ways to communicate enthalpy changes  for a chemical reaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How are       enthalpy changes communicated?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 7&mdash;Hess&rsquo;  Law</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 7 you will learn to use Hess&rsquo; law, an alternative method to calculate  enthalpy change for a system without using a calorimeter. You will consider why  this method  might be used instead of obtaining  a value through experimentation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is Hess&rsquo;       law?</li>
  <li>How does       Hess&rsquo; law relate to enthalpies of reaction?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 8&mdash;Molar  Enthalpy of Formation</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 8 you will use standard molar enthalpies of formation to  calculate the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following  lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How are       standard molar enthalpies of formation used to determine the enthalpy       change associated with chemical reactions?</li>
</ul>
