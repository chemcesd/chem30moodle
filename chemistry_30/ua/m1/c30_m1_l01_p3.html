<p>Food is more than just calories and kilojoules. The updated Canada
Food Guide focuses on serving size and the number of servings eaten per
day. In Modules 5 and 6 you will learn more about the carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats contained in foods. You will also discover how these
dietary components perform vital functions for your body. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to use the Internet to obtain a copy of the Canada Food
Guide or to find dietary information for athletes. This information
will help you learn more about how appropriate nutritional and dietary
choices can affect the health of your ecotour participants.</p>

<p>Retrieve the Module 1: Lesson 1 Assignment that you saved to your
computer earlier in this lesson. You will record your personal energy
intake in a spreadsheet. Complete the Assignment and save it in your
course folder. You will receive information later in this lesson on

</div>
<p>Regardless of what food you eat, the energy you consume originally
came from the sun. Solar energy is converted into chemical potential
energy by plants as they photosynthesize. The energy contained within
plants and/or animals is captured by living organisms when the plants
and/or animals (the food) undergo a chemical reaction like digestion or
combustion.</p>

</div>
<p>Fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum, natural gas, and oil sand,
are an important energy source. Fossil fuels contain <strong>hydrocarbon
molecules</strong>. Hydrocarbons typically tend to be high-energy
molecules, since the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and between
hydrogen and carbon atoms store a relatively large quantity of
potential energy. Burning a fossil fuel releases the energy stored in
these high-energy bonds. In your home, the combustion of fossil fuels
can be used for many purposes, including heating your home.</p>

<h6>An Analysis of the Carbon Cycle</h6>
<p><br>
The carbon cycle is a summary of the major reactions involving carbon
compounds in the biosphere. You may have seen a diagram of the carbon
cycle in previous science courses. In this activity you will complete
an analysis of a diagram of the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Print a copy of the <a
 href="c30_m1_l01_p3_001.html" target="_blank">carbon cycle diagram</a>.
Examine the diagram to refresh your memory of the carbon cycle and its
processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Prepare a chart listing similarities and
differences between the following chemical processes, which are part of
the carbon cycle: photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and combustion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include an example of a chemical reaction for each process in your
chart. You may wish to use the Internet or other resources to find
information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Examine the diagram of the carbon cycle.
Determine the correct position on the diagram for each term you
researched in Step 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Write a brief paragraph to identify the
important aspects of the carbon cycle.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> How is a knowledge of the carbon cycle
important to your efforts to design an ecotour that will minimize
impacts on the environment?</p>
