<p>Want to see the North? Canada's northern-most regions are becoming
tourism hotspots. Before visiting the Arctic you will want to make sure
your visit will not harm the area's delicate ecology. You might
consider &#8220;going eco&#8221; on your next holiday!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecotourism&#8212;the opportunity to visit and observe natural habitat and
wildlife without leaving a negative ecological footprint&#8212;is the new
rage. Ecotourism encourages the use of sustainable resources and the
promotion of sustainable development within the area visited. It also
focuses on minimizing the impact of visitors on the wilderness
showcased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecotourism can provide for many unique holidays ranging from
observing wildlife such as wolves, beluga whales, muskoxen, and
caribou; to more energetic pursuits like canoe trips, whale watching in
kayaks, travel by komatik, cross-country skiing, snow shoeing, and
hiking. Ecotour accommodations vary from tents on the tundra to cozy
lodges with gourmet meals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When planning and delivering ecotours, ecoguides and tour operators
must make many logistical decisions including how their tour
participants will move around and what fuel will power any vehicles
participants use.</p>
