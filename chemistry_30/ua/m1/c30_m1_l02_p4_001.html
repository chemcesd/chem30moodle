<p><img src="../../images/m1/015_solar heating_large.jpg" alt="A graphic shows a diagram titled Active Solar Heating System. An outline of a house is shown with a solar heat collector located on the roof. The solar heat collector consists of a layer of high transmittance glass over an absorber sheet with optical coating and copper tubing. Inside the copper tubing is an antifreeze solution. Cool antifreeze solution is pumped from a solar storage tank located inside the house to the collector. Warm antifreeze is pumped from the collector to the solar storage tank. Inside the solar storage tank is a heat exchanger that is connected to a furnace. In the furnace, warm air is released to heat the house." width="633" height="421" /></p>
