<p><br />
  In  Lesson 7 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is Hess&rsquo; law?</li>
  <li>How does Hess&rsquo; law       relate to enthalpies of reaction?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hess&rsquo;  law is a thermodynamic principle that states that the addition of chemical  equations yields a net chemical equation with an enthalpy change equal to the sum  of the enthalpy changes of the steps. Hess&rsquo; law can be used to determine the  enthalpy change for reactions that are not able to be investigated  experimentally. You evaluated the process used to investigate chemical  reactions as multistep processes, and you completed a laboratory exercise to test  a hypothesis made using Hess&rsquo; law.</p>
