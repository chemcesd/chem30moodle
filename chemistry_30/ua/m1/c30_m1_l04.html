<p>Cross-country skiing is a popular sport and may be one of the
activities participants in an ecotour might undertake. Skiing is
physically strenuous and requires a lot of energy. In addition to the
large amount of energy used to cross the snow-covered terrain, a skier
will expend energy to maintain his or her body temperature in cold
winter weather. To conserve energy, paralympians sometimes use hot
packs on their legs while training and racing on extremely cold days.
Can you think of a similarity between a human body and a hot pack with
respect to energy changes? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m1/022_hotpack.jpg"

<p><span class="nowrap">In previous</span> science courses you learned
that the human body is designed to convert chemical energy from the
food we eat into energy cells can use. Heat is a common by-product of
cellular processes. A hot pack also releases energy as heat when a
change occurs in the matter inside. Energy changes can be classified as
either <strong>exothermic</strong> or <strong>endothermic. </strong>An
exothermic process will warm its surroundings as it radiates energy.
Endothermic processes absorb heat from the surroundings,<strong> </strong>often
reducing the temperature of the surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockA">
<p><strong>exothermic:</strong> a process that radiates energy to its
surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic:</strong> a process that absorbs energy from its
surroundings </p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
From your study of biology you know that humans are made up of millions
of tiny cells. When you study chemistry you also consider the
interactions of matter at the particle level. Why do the reactions
involved in the use of food and those involved in the hot pack create
heat? What is happening in both of these processes at the particle
level, and how do those changes relate to the energy change involved in
each of these processes? In Lesson 4 you will explore enthalpy changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 4:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What changes occur during a chemical reaction at the particle
level?</li>
  <li>Why do chemical changes and energy changes occur at the same time?</li>
  <li>
    <p>What is enthalpy?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this lesson you will<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>draw cartoons to illustrate the different kinds of energy matter
can have</li>
  <li>analyze calorimetric data and quantify the energy changes that
occur</li>
  <li>review the assumptions involved in calorimetry as they relate to
enthalpy changes</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no assignment for this lesson; however, you will complete
Try This and Reflect and Connect.</p>
