<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Background  Information</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you learned about bomb calorimeters and how they  are used to measure the energy content of food. Bomb calorimeters are  complicated technical devices and are not available in most high school  science laboratories. In this investigation you will construct and determine  the precision of a simpler version of a calorimeter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p><br />
  In this investigation you will construct and determine the  precision of a calorimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Problem</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the precision of the calorimeter tested as determined by percent experimental error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" alt="" width="35" height="31" /> Retrieve your copy of the Module 1: Lesson 3 Assignment that you saved to your   computer earlier in this lesson. You will  record data and complete your analysis  in your Lesson 3 Assignment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Materials</strong>
<ul>
  <li>four  polystyrene cups</li>
  <li>thermometer</li>
  <li>electronic balance</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>kettle</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you have access to the materials listed, you may be able to perform this investigation.</p>
<p><br />
  <img src="../icons/watch_and_listen.gif" width="35" height="31" /> If you do not have access to these materials and a supervised laboratory, or if you would like to see the lab performed before you attempt it, view the  virtual investigation &ldquo;<a href="../../mm/m1/c_water/index.html" target="_blank">Lesson 3 Lab: Constructing and Testing a Calorimeter</a>.&rdquo; If you will not be completing the lab youself, remember to record data and observations as you view the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Procedure</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Construct a calorimeter by nesting two polystyrene cups.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a       hole in the bottom of the third polystyrene cup. A thermometer will be inserted into this hole later. <br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use       the electronic balance to measure and record the mass of the calorimeter, including the lid.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove       the calorimeter from the balance. Add room temperature water to the       calorimeter until it is just less than half full.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use       the electronic balance to measure and record the mass of the half-full       calorimeter, including the lid.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Place the lid on the calorimeter and use       the thermometer to measure the water temperature in the calorimeter.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use       the kettle to prepare warm water with a temperature of approximately 60 &deg;C.<br />  
  <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Add       warm water from the kettle to the fourth cup until it is just less than       one-third full.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Use       the electronic balance to measure and record the mass of the fourth cup       containing the warm water.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong>  Place the lid on the calorimeter and use       the thermometer to measure the temperature of the warm water.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Transfer the contents of the fourth cup to the  calorimeter. Attach the lid to the calorimeter. Insert the thermometer through  the hole made in Step 2, and use the thermometer to gently mix the contents of  the calorimeter. While mixing the contents, observe the temperature change and  record the highest temperature for the calorimeter contents.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Use       the electronic balance to measure and record the mass of the fourth cup.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Empty       the contents of the calorimeter, dry the inside of the calorimeter, and       repeat Steps 4&ndash;12 to obtain data for nine more trials.<br />  
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Clean each apparatus used, and return each       apparatus to its appropriate place in the laboratory.</p>
