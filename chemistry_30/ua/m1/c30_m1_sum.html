<p>We live in a world that is dependent upon energy. In Module 1 you
learned about energy and energy transformations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You considered the following module questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Should energy be given a higher priority when making decisions
about society&#8217;s future?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>How does society use the energy of chemical changes?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>What are the impacts of energy use on the environment?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>How does society use knowledge of the energy associated with
chemical process to promote sustainability?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In what ways have issues of energy use affected the development
of past and present societies?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 2 you will further consider the differences between the
energy content of different fuels. You will use this information to
evaluate alternative fuels that could be used to fuel vehicles used in
your ecotour.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 1, you may have added information to a
concept map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson
questions listed in the Module 1 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time
to review the relationships in your concept map or graphic organizer
and to try to answer the module and lesson questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> A <a href="../../images/pdf_files/m1/031a_organizer.pdf"
 target="_blank">sample Module 1 concept map</a> shows one set of
possible links between the questions. Remember that this is one
possible description only&#8212;there are many other correct possibilities.
However, if your completed concept map or graphic organizer differs
significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your teacher or
to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your
class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials
and your descriptions are accurate.</p>
