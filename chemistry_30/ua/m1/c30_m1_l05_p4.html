<p>To review what you have learned in the first five lessons in Module
1, try one of the following learning strategies:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Review the concept map or graphic organizer you have been adding
to throughout Module 1. Remember to use linking statements to explain
how you understand the concepts to be connected.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Use the Module 1 Concept Organizer as a starting point for
another style of summarixing information (e.g., a list of key words, a
concept map, a flow chart, or an outline).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Review the lesson glossaries by covering up the definitions and
defining each term in your own words.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Create test questions and answers on flash cards.</li>
</ul>
