<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 4 you considered the following questions: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What changes occur during a  chemical reaction at the particle level?</li>
  <li>Why do chemical       changes and energy changes occur at the same time?</li>
  <li>What is enthalpy?</li>
</ul>
<p>You  studied both theoretical and empirical aspects of matter and energy changes.  You used cartoons and other methods to explain changes in matter and you analyzed  data to calculate energy changes. You learned that an enthalpy change is the  change in the kinetic and potential energy of a system and that an enthalpy  change can be quantified using a calorimeter. </p>

<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>chemical potential energy:</strong> a stored form of energy  dependent on the relative positions of particles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic:</strong> a process that absorbs  energy from its surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>enthalpy:</strong> the total kinetic and  potential energy in a system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic:</strong> a process that radiates  energy to its surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>kinetic energy: </strong>a form of energy related to  the motion of particles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kinetic  energy can involve vibration, rotation, or translation within or of a particle.  Kinetic energy changes are often observed as a temperature change in matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>kinetic molecular theory:</strong> a theory that states that small particles that make up a substance are in continuous motion  and collide with each other and objects in their path
