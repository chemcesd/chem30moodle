<p>Many new homes are being constructed in Alberta, and a large number
of these buildings have highly energy-efficient designs. Use the
Internet to find out more about the term <em>R-2000</em>. Find
standards for new home construction, and compare these standards to
construction practices of ten or more years ago. For example, you may
wish to compare the design and materials used in your own home to those
that meet R-2000 standards. How important is insulation and the
specific heat capacity of materials to R-2000 design?<br>
