          <h5>Module Glossary</h5>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>calorimeter:</strong> an isolated system in which the chemical system being studied is surrounded by a known quantity of  liquid</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>calorimetry:</strong> the technological process of measuring the energy changes of an isolated system</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>carbohydrate:</strong> a carbon compound that  contains many hydroxyl groups and has the general chemical formula C<span class="subscript"><em>n</em></span>H<span class="subscript">2<em>n</em></span>O<span class="subscript"><em>n</em></span>  (e.g., glucose, C<span class="subscript">6</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span>O<span class="subscript">6</span>)</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p><strong>chemical potential energy:</strong> a stored form of energy  dependent on the relative positions of particles</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>endothermic:</strong> a process that absorbs  energy from its surroundings</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>enthalpy:</strong> the total kinetic and  potential energy in a system</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>enthalpy  of reaction: </strong>the change in the energy of a chemical system as it proceeds from reactants to products</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>exothermic:</strong> a process that radiates  energy to its surroundings</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>hydrocarbon molecule:</strong> a chemical compound containing only hydrogen and carbon  atoms</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>kinetic energy: </strong>a form of energy related to  the motion of particles</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Kinetic  energy can involve vibration, rotation, or translation within or of a particle.  Kinetic energy changes are often observed as a temperature change in matter.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>kinetic molecular theory:</strong> a theory that states that small particles that make up a substance are in continuous motion  and collide with each other and objects in their path</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>magnitude:</strong> a value that indicates size or quantity</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>molar  enthalpy: </strong>a  change in enthalpy of a chemical system <em>per mole</em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>quantitative: </strong>an observation that uses a numeric value</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>reference  energy state:</strong> a reference point at which the potential energy of the elements in  their most stable form at SATP is defined as zero</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>specific heat capacity:</strong> a physical  property of matter</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It is the energy required  to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance one degree Celsius.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>standard  enthalpy of formation:</strong> the enthalpy change calculated from the measurements of a formation reaction  under standard conditions</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>thermal conductance:</strong> the rate at which thermal energy flows through a substance</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>thermal  stability:</strong> the tendency of a compound to resist decomposition when heated</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          The  lower a compound's standard enthalpy of formation, the more stable the compound.
