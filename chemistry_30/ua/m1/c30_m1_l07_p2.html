<p>In Lesson 2 you used a calorimeter to measure the enthalpy of a
reaction. You also learned that by using a bomb calorimeter you can
improve the reliability and range of reactions that you can
investigate. However, is it possible to measure the enthalpy change of
every reaction using a calorimeter? Is it possible to use your
understanding of chemical potential energy to explain why energy
changes occur during chemical reactions? Have you considered how this
understanding might be used to determine the enthalpy change for a
process if it cannot be done experimentally?</p>
<p><br>
Read pages 502&#8211;503 in the textbook to learn about Hess&#8217; law.</p>

<p><strong>SC 1.</strong> It may not be possible to determine the
energy change for a reaction experimentally if the reaction occurs too
slowly, if equipment is unavailable, or if there are safety concerns.</p>

The overall change is -110.5 kJ, which represents the difference
between the initial and final potential energies of the reactants and
the final product. The sum of the reaction enthalpies <span

Use your answers to the Self-Check questions and the information in
your textbook to demonstrate your understanding of Hess' law by
answering the following questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following information about a theoretical chemical
system:</p>
<p><br>
Reaction 1: AB &#8594; A + B &#916;<span class="subscript">r</span><em>H</em> =
+75 kJ<br>
Reaction 2: A + CD &#8594; AC + D &#916;<span class="subscript">r</span><em>H</em>
= -50 kJ<br>
Reaction 3: BD &#8594; B + D &#916;<span class="subscript">r</span><em>H</em> =
-125 kJ<br>
Net Reaction: AB + CD &#8594; AC + BD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Demonstrate how reactions 1&#8211;3 can be combined
to yield the net reaction.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>TR 2.</strong> Demonstrate how reactions 1&#8211;3 can be depicted on
a potential energy diagram such that the enthalpy change for the net
reaction is depicted.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>TR 3.</strong> Demonstrate how the enthalpy change for
reactions 1&#8211;3 are combined to result in an enthalpy change for the net
reaction.</p>

<p>To some people, the most important rules for Hess&#8217; law are as
follows: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>If the chemical reaction is reversed, then the sign of the change
in enthalpy is reversed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If the coefficients of the chemical reaction are altered, then
the change in enthalpy is also altered by the same factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easy to memorize these rules, but it is important to do more
than memorize them&#8212;you must understand them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 4. </strong>Write explanations that identify the
scientific principles associated with each of these rules and state why
these rules need to be considered when using Hess&#8217; law.</p>
