<p>In this lesson you will investigate the energy changes that occur
during the chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis, cellular
respiration, and combustion. You will learn how these reactions are
part of the carbon cycle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy is involved in every activity. In this lesson you will
investigate the quantity of energy you intake to support your daily
activities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does society use the energy of chemical changes?</li>
  <li>How do you use the energy of chemical changes in your life?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Lesson 1 Assignment you will prepare a spreadsheet to
calculate your personal energy intake. Download a copy of the
teacher-marked <a href="c30_m1_l01_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module
1: Lesson 1 Assignment</a> to your computer at this time. You will
receive further instructions on how to complete this assignment later
in the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other questions in this lesson are not marked by the teacher;
however, you must answer these questions. The Self-Check, Try This, and
other types of questions are placed in this lesson to help you review
important information and build key concepts that may be applied in
future lessons. You should record the answers to all the questions in
the lesson and place those answers in your binder.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Your teacher will
ask to see your bookwork from the Self-Check questions before you write
your unit tests.</span><br>
