<p>One of the essential pieces of gear for an ecotourist is a sleeping
bag suited to the climate. A sleeping bag that is too warm will cause
you to sweat, and one that makes you feel too cool will result in you
shivering through the night. Sleeping bags are rated according to the
materials used in their construction and can be suitable for
temperatures ranging from <span class="nowrap">&#8722;40&deg;C</span> to <span
 class="nowrap">+15&deg;C</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sleeping bag is designed to insulate a person by attempting to
prevent an energy exchange between the person and the surroundings. In
Lesson 2 you learned about the design of a calorimeter. It might sound
like the insulating characteristics of a sleeping bag are similar to
those of a calorimeter&#8212;both are designed to prevent an exchange of
thermal energy between the "contents" and its surroundings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will test a calorimeter that you construct using
data collected while performing an experiment. You will also
investigate the specific heat capacity of substances and relate this
property to the selection of materials that may be used to design a
sleeping bag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 3:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How can knowledge of specific heat capacity be used in the
design of a sleeping bag?</li>
</ul>
