<p>All forms of transportation require energy. What forms of energy and
energy sources are necessary in the forms of transportation shown in
the graphic? What relationship do these forms of energy have to the
sun? If you were to go on an ecotour of your local area, which forms of
transportation would best fit your tour's needs? Why would you have to
rely on those forms of energy? Is there a way to make transportation in
your area less harmful to the environment?</p>

environment. <br>

<strong>TR 3.</strong> What is a carbon offset?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 4.</strong> Is offering a traveller the opportunity to
purchase a carbon offset consistent with the principles of ecotourism?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 5.</strong> Does allowing a traveller the opportunity to
buy a carbon offset make this person more conscious of society's
choices regarding energy use?</p>
