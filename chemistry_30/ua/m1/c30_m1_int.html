<p>Energy is defined as the capacity of a substance or  system  to do work. Energy&mdash;including the  development and export of natural resources such as coal, natural gas, oil,  and bitumen from oil sand&mdash;is an important part of Alberta&rsquo;s economy. Energy is also an important part of your daily life. You rely heavily on  fossil fuels to provide energy to heat your home and to power the machinery, equipment, electronics, and more that are part of almost  every part of your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy can come in a variety of forms. Almost all of the events  that occurred earlier in your day today involved energy in some form. Your alarm clock&rsquo;s conversion of electrical energy into sound energy may have woken you up. Your water heater&rsquo;s transformation of chemical potential energy from natural  gas or another fuel into thermal energy probably provided the warm water for your shower. In this  module you  will investigate the quantity of energy involved in your daily activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 1 will focus on various energy sources and will consider  those sources within the context of providing energy for the activities you enjoy. You  will learn ways to measure and calculate energy change during chemical  reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Module 1 you will investigate the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Should energy be given a higher priority when making decisions about society&rsquo;s future? </li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How does society use the energy of chemical changes?</li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are the impacts of energy use on the environment?</li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How does society use knowledge of the energy associated with chemical processes to promote sustainability?</li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>In what ways have issues of energy use affected the development of past and present societies?</li>
  </ul>
<p>Remember that each lesson will also be organized around questions intended to guide your study. As you proceed through Module 1, you may record answers to these questions and  any interrelationships that exist between them in a concept map or graphic organizer. More information is available in the <a href="../c30_ua_org.html" target="_blank">Unit A Concept Organizer</a>. In the Module 1 Summary  you will receive further information on how you can use your concept map or graphic organizer to review  the concepts you studied in this module.</p>
