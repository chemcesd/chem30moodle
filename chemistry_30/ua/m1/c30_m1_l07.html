<p>Hiking is a popular ecotour activity. Participants often want to see
remote, untouched areas to get a sense of the natural habitat. Hiking
in the Drumheller Badlands provides a great opportunity to learn about
geology, paleontology, and other science disciplines while enjoying
hiking's many other benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the photograph shown, the trail the hikers are on dips downward
and then slopes upward again. How do these small changes in elevation
affect the hikers&#8217; level of effort?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last lesson you used chemical potential energy diagrams to
represent the enthalpy change of a reaction. What does a change in
position on a potential energy diagram represent?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have probably hiked over hilly terrain before. Did you break
your hike into manageable goals or steps? Did breaking your hike into
steps affect the outcome of your day&#8217;s effort? Chances are that
thinking in steps and taking frequent breaks got you to the end of your
journey refreshed and having enjoyed some of the sights along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaking a hike into small steps could be an analogy for a chemical
reaction performed as a series of steps that results in the desired
products. Is there a difference in the enthalpy change of reaction for
the total process when it occurs in steps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 7: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is Hess&#8217; law?</li>
  <li>How does Hess&#8217; law relate to enthalpies of reaction?</li>
</ul>

<p>In Lesson 8 you will complete an assignment that covers material
from Lessons 6, 7, and 8. It is important that you continue to
summarize what you learn as you work through these lessons.</p>
