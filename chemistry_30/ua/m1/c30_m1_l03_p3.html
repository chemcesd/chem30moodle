<p>Specific heat capacity is the energy required to change the
temperature of one gram of a substance one degree Celsius. As you
watched the video &#8220;Energy Transfers&#8221; you observed that the water in the
calorimeter decreased in temperature. Assume that the piece of metal
placed into the calorimeter in the video was allowed to cool to
&#8211;20.0&deg;C in a freezer. Given this information and the data you
collected from the video, could you determine the specific heat
capacity of the metal object?</p>

<p>A sleeping bag is given a comfort rating, which is the lowest
temperature limit at which the bag provides adequate insulation. Data
from two sleeping bags are shown.</p>

<p>How do you think the two bags compare in terms of their specific
heat capacities? Can you identify any assumptions involved in your
prediction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although sleeping bags can appear to have similar heat capacities
and insulating properties, their compositions can be very different.
The style, the materials used in construction, and the method of
assembly can influence the insulating properties and the comfort rating
of sleeping bags.</p>

<p>Thermal energy transfers between warmer and cooler objects until
both objects reach the same temperature. The function of a sleeping
bag, or the clothes you wear, is to contain the air around your body
that has been warmed from heat your body has emitted. Materials that
provide better insulation from the cold tend to prevent trapped air
that has been heated by the body from escaping. It is common for winter
campers to place a vapour bag within a sleeping bag. The vapour bag
fits inside the sleeping bag like a sleeve and is designed to transfer
perspiration (water) away from the air surrounding the body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RC 1.</strong> The specific heat capacity of water is 4.19
kJ/(kg&#8226;&deg;C), while the specific heat capacity of air is 1.01
kJ/(kg&#8226;&deg;C). Use this data to explain how using a vapour bag can
increase a person's comfort in a sleeping bag.</p>
