<strong>Procedure</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find at  least ten foods in your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Predict  the amount of energy contained in one serving of each food by ranking the foods from highest to lowest energy content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the  nutrition label or the Internet to determine the energy content of each food.  If the energy content is given in calories, multiply the number of calories by 4.19 and record the  value as kilojoules (kJ) in your table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Analysis</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Calculate the energy content per gram for each food. Rank  the foods from highest to lowest energy content per gram.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Compare your ranking of predicted energy content with your ranking based on calculated  values. Explain any differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
