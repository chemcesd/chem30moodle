  In previous science  courses you  learned that chemical reactions occur as a result of colliding  particles. To understand why a chemical reaction occurs and what events occur  during a reaction, you may have to imagine a reaction in very slow motion.</p>
<p><br />
  Read pages 524&ndash;526  in the textbook to learn about the events that occur during a chemical  reaction.</p>

    <p><strong>Practice 1.</strong></p>

      The molecules must  have sufficient energy and be in the proper orientation when they collide. If  these two conditions are met, a reaction can occur.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 2.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Scientific: A  better understanding of how chemical reactions occur might improve the ability  to predict when chemical reactions might occur, including the effect that  catalysts and other substances have on the progress of a reaction. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Technological: A  better understanding of how chemical reactions occur may lead to the  development of new processes that improve efficiency or reduce the generation  of by-products.</p>

  So what does a  spark really do in terms of starting a combustion reaction? In the previous  section you learned that molecules must collide with sufficient energy to cause a reaction. From where do the  molecules get that energy? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you may have suspected,  energy to initiate a combustion reaction can come from a spark, the flame from  a match, or, in the case of a spontaneous combustion, from the heat of a hot  day. Read the section &ldquo;Activation Energy of a Reaction&rdquo; on pages 526&ndash;530 in the  textbook to learn more about the energy required to initiate a reaction.</p>

<p>Answer the  following question in which you will interpret and apply your textbook reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> It is a common observation that vapourized hydrocarbons combust more  readily than liquid hydrocarbons. Use a potential energy diagram to compare the potential energy of a vapourized hydrocarbon  to the potential energy of the same hydrocarbon in the liquid phase. In addition, use the difference in potential energy between the two phases to explain  this observation and how it relates to energy of activation within a chemical  system.</p>

    <strong>SC 3.</strong>

    <p><strong>Section 12.2  1. </strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Bond energy is the  energy required to break a chemical bond, and it is the energy released when a  chemical bond is formed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Section 12.2  2. </strong></p>
    <p><br />
      In the reactant  molecules, if the bonds that are being broken are strong, the activation energy  is likely to be high. If the bonds being broken are weak, it is likely that the  activation energy will be relatively low.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Section 12.2  3. </strong></p>
    <p><br />
      By definition, a  chemical reaction involves a rearrangement of bonds to produce new substances  in which atoms are conserved but the bonding is different. This can only happen  if at least some bonds are broken and new ones are formed. For example, in the  decomposition of water, O-H bonds are broken and H-H and O=O bonds are formed.</p>
