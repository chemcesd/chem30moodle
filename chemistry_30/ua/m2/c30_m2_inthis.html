<h4>In This Module </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&#8212;Alternative Fuels: Biodiesel </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will make and test biodiesel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What makes a good fuel?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&#8212;Energy Diagrams and Activation Energy </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you will consider the events that occur during a
chemical reaction from the molecular level. You will learn about
activation energy, and you will integrate this concept into your
understanding of enthalpy changes for reactions involving endothermic
and exothermic change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Why is energy needed to start an exothermic reaction?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&#8212;Catalysts </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catalysts are important components of industrial and biological
systems. In Lesson 3 you will learn how catalysts affect the rate of
chemical reactions, including the production of biodiesel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a catalyst?</li>
  <li>How does a catalyst influence a chemical reaction?</li>
</ul>
