Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module completes your study of thermochemical changes that
began in Module 1. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You considered the following module questions, some of which you
began to examine in Module 1:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What energy changes must be considered when designing chemical
systems?<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Should energy be given a higher priority when making decisions
about society&#8217;s future? <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>How does society use the energy of chemical changes?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What are the impacts of energy use on the environment?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>How does society use knowledge of the energy associated with
chemical processes to promote sustainability?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In what ways have issues of energy use affected the development
of past and present societies?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Module 2 you investigated energy changes in chemical reactions by
focusing on changes that occur at the molecular level. You learned
about activation energy and its role in every chemical reaction, and
you learned about the conditions necessary for molecules to participate
in a chemical reaction. You also learned about catalysts and their
ability to lower activation energy and thereby increase the rate of a
chemical reaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You completed a virtual investigation in which you made and tested
biodiesel, and you researched biodiesel&#8217;s use as a vehicle. The
information you learned in Module 2 will provide a foundation for your
learning in other units of this course, especially in Unit D where you
will investigate equilibrium of chemical systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 2, you may have added information to a
concept map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson
questions listed in the Module 2 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time
to review the relationships in your concept map or graphic organizer
and to try to answer the module and lesson questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../../images/pdf_files/m2/labled_organizer.pdf"
 target="_blank">sample Module 2 concept map</a> shows one set of
possible links between the questions. Remember that this is one
possible description only&#8212;there are many other correct possibilities.
However, if your completed concept map or graphic organizer differs
significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your teacher or
to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your
class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials
and your descriptions are accurate.</p>
