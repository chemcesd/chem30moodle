<p><strong>SC 2. </strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice  2.</strong> </p>
<p><br />
  The hypothesis that  reactions have an activation energy is suggested by experiments that show energy  may be required to initiate a reaction, even if the reaction is self-sustaining  once started. An example would be combustion of hydrogen. Also, the fact that  similar reactions occur at different rates suggests that the reason for the difference in reaction rates may be  differing activation energies. The reactions of alkali metals with water  illustrate this. Furthermore, if there were no activation energies, then  spontaneous reactions would all occur almost instantaneously. In addition,  experiments demonstrating the effect of catalysts are readily explained by  hypothesizing the existence of an activation energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice  3.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The reaction is endothermic.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>(i) represents the activation energy of the forward reaction and (ii) represents the enthalpy change for the reaction.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>As the reactant molecules approach each other, their combined kinetic  energy is at a maximum and the relative potential energy is at a minimum. As they collide and &ldquo;climb&rdquo; the energy barrier, kinetic energy is converted to potential energy. Provided they have enough kinetic energy in the first place, they  will surmount the barrier. At the top of the energy profile, the potential energy of the system will be at a maximum and the kinetic energy will be at a  minimum. At the end of the reaction the system will have less kinetic and more  potential energy than it did originally.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Practice  4.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  They differ in that  the enthalpy change is the net difference in potential energy between reactants  and products, whereas the activation energy is the height of the energy barrier  that must be surmounted to achieve a successful collision. They are similar in  that each is a difference in potential energy. In the case of the activation  energy, it is the difference in potential energy between the reactants and the  activated complex rather than between reactants and products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>There must be an adequate supply of oxygen to burn the hydrogen, and the reaction  needs to be initiated by a spark or flame to overcome the activation energy.<br />
    <br />

<p><strong>Practice  6.</strong><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p><br />
  The purpose of this  investigation is to test the hypothesis that the activation energy decreases  from sodium to cesium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p><br />
  What evidence is  there that from sodium to cesium, there is a decrease in the activation energy  for the reaction with water? The manipulating variable is the alkali metal used,  and the responding variable is the observed reaction rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p><br />
  For the reaction with water, the activation energy from sodium to cesium decreases. If the metal reacts more violently with water, then the reaction has a lower activation energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <strong>Design</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Separate small samples  of sodium, potassium, and cesium with equal masses will be dropped into water. Evidence of differences in reaction rate will be observed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <strong>Prediction</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Cesium will react  the fastest and sodium the slowest, indicating that the activation energy  decreases from sodium to cesium.</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Wear eye  protection, apron, and gloves throughout the procedure, and only combine the  reactants behind a safety screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Measure 100 mL of water into a 250-mL beaker, and place the beaker  behind a safety screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Using the knife, cut a small piece of sodium (half the size of a small raisin) and remove it from the container in which it was being stored under oil. Place the piece on a paper towel to remove excess oil. Quickly measure the mass of the sodium, ensuring it is 0.50 g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Grasp the sodium with tweezers and dab it with paper towel to remove  some oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Quickly reach around the screen and drop the piece of sodium into the  beaker of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Record evidence for reaction with particular attention to the rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Repeat Steps 1 to 5 for potassium and cesium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Dispose of the reaction mixtures down the drain.</p>
