<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you considered the following questions: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a catalyst?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How does a catalyst influence a       chemical reaction? </li>
</ul>
<p>Catalysts are  important components of industrial and biological systems. The use of catalysts  increases the rate at which a reaction occurs, thus allowing for the more rapid  production of products. In this lesson you saw how catalysts allow unique  chemical systems like fuel cells and petroleum cracking to occur with  significantly reduced energy input. You also evaluated the use of a catalyst in the production of biodiesel from more perspectives than just efficiency and rate of reaction.  You considered cost of production, environmental aspects, and safety concerns.</p>
