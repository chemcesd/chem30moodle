<p>Many ecotours have made the decision to use biodiesel in their
vehicles where possible. What is biodiesel and how does its use promote
sustainability? In Lesson 1 you will learn about biodiesel. You will
begin to evaluate its properties and suitability as a fuel. To assist
in your evaluation you will make and test biodiesel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 1: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What makes a good fuel?</li>
</ul>
