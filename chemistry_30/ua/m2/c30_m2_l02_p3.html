<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 2, Reflect on the Big Picture will prepare you for the Module 2   Assessment in which you will prepare a presentation defending a position on the   use of biodiesel by your ecotour company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the previous  lesson you saw that biodiesel requires more effort to light compared to  methanol. Since biodiesel is a mixture of molecules, it is difficult to make  conclusions about its activation energy relative to other hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your investigation about the performance of biodiesel you may have already found that  biodiesel performs very similarly to diesel fuel in terms of  engine operation and fuel economy. Is this true at all temperatures? If your ecotour involves winter activities, will using biodiesel present a problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research how biodiesel performs compared to conventional diesel fuel and how biodiesel performs at temperatures similar to those you will encounter when operating your ecotour. Remember to consider the qualities you researched in Lesson 1 as you compare the two fuels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your notes in your ecotour planning sub-folder. Remember to  collect information that is accurate (correct) and reliable (consistent with the results from other or repeated tests).  You will be required to use the information you collect to support your position on the use of biodiesel, so it is important to consider the source and the number of sources from which you collect your information. Remember that you will refine and add to your research as you progress through Module 2. </p>
