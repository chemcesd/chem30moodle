<p>Biodiesel is a fuel that has been receiving a great deal of
attention. Oil from the canola plants pictured to the right of the
cyclists in the photograph can be used to produce biodiesel, as can
waste vegetable oil from restaurants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 2 you will learn more about energy changes in chemical
reactions while investigating the production, testing, and use of
biodiesel as a possible fuel source for vehicles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of biodiesel as a vehicle fuel will tie into the Module 2.
Read on to learn more about the lessons, activities, and assessments
you will complete as you progress through Module 2.</p>
