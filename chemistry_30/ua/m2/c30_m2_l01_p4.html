<p>In the analysis for the investigation you were asked to calculate an
energy of combustion per gram of biodiesel combusted. The biodiesel
that you made in the investigation is not a pure substance. The
biodiesel contained many products including different organic acids,
glycerol, and products of incomplete or side reactions. Can you explain
why the mixture of combustible materials in biodiesel makes it
impossible to calculate the biodiesel&#8217;s molar mass and a molar enthalpy
for its combustion? Can you think of other examples where it is not
possible to calculate an energy content per mole of substance?</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<br>
<p>In this lesson you completed a virtual investigation in which you
prepared biodiesel and tested it to determine its energy of combustion
per gram. At the beginning of this lesson you were asked to consider
the possible use of biodiesel as a fuel for vehicles. Does biodiesel
measure up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>If you were to asses biodiesel as a fuel you would
have to consider the following qualities of biodiesel:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>energy content relative to other fuels<br>
  </li>
  <li>availability relative to other fuels<br>
  </li>
  <li>cleanliness of combustion<br>
  </li>
  <li>ease of preparation</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wish to consider these qualities from different perspectives
as you develop your response. For example, the availability of
biodiesel may be seen differently from an ecological or economic
perspective as opposed to a scientific one. </p>
