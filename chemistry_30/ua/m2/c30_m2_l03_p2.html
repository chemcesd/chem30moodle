<p>In the previous  lesson you learned about activation energy, the energy required to initiate a  chemical reaction. You considered the combustion of hydrocarbons and the energy  required to &ldquo;activate&rdquo; molecules. You learned that once the reacting particles have reached the necessary activation energy, the chemical reaction, in this case a combustion reaction, can occur. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 2 Lessons 1 and 2,  you learned that molecules need to have sufficient energy and must collide in the correct  orientation in order for the bond between atoms in the reactants to be broken  and for new bonds to form. For  some chemical reactions, the energy required to initiate chemical change can be quite high.  As you learned in Lesson 1, reactions with higher activation energies tend to occur more slowly.  If you are depending on a reaction, and need it to occur quickly, how can you overcome the problem of a high activation energy slowing your reaction rate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  </div>
<p>You may have  learned about fuel cells in previous science courses. Many fuel cells appear to  use a reaction that looks like a combustion reaction. For example, the  hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell used in the space program relies on the reaction 2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) +  O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) &rarr; 2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reaction is  also the basis for a hydrogen &ldquo;pop&rdquo; test you may have performed in previous science courses. When performing a hydrogen pop test,  a burning splint is placed into  a test tube containing a small quantity of hydrogen gas.  As you learned earlier, the flame serves as a source of energy. The energy helps the reactants achieve the activation energy required for the reactants to engage in collision and form the products of the reaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the space  program hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants in a fuel cell&mdash;a device that converts chemical potential energy into electrical energy.  The electricity produced by the fuel cells in a spacecraft run all the major systems inside the spacecraft including lighting, communication, and life support. Due to the risk of explosion,  the reaction  between hydrogen and oxygen cannot involve a spark flame, but it still requires an input of energy  to proceed.  How can this be done without a flame?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockA">
  <p><strong>catalyst:</strong> a substance that reduces the energy necessary to start a chemical reaction </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of a chemical process but are not consumed during the process.</p>
</div>
<p>Look at the  fuel cell pictured. You will see a membrane in the middle of the cell. The  chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the fuel cell occurs on this membrane. Using  a structure like this allows the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to occur  without the need for any more energy than the gases already have at room temperature.  Since the membrane in a fuel cell allows the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to occur with a lower activation energy, the membrane acts as a <strong>catalyst</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A catalyst is  something within a chemical system that lowers the activation energy required  for a reaction to occur by allowing an alternate path for the reaction. This  last point is very well demonstrated by the fuel cell membrane, since the membrane acts to  physically separate the hydrogen and oxygen gases, meaning they never actually  collide with one another. By using a catalyst, a different mechanism for the  reaction occurs, and the product H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l) is made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many industrial  processes, including the production of biodiesel, involve the use of catalysts.  In industrial settings catalysts are often used because they increase the rate  (speed) of a reaction without being consumed in the overall process. Often,  they also allow a reaction to occur at a lower temperature than would otherwise  be possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 535&ndash;538  in the textbook. Stop reading when you get to the section &ldquo;Catalysts and the  Nature of Science.&rdquo; As you read this section, pay special attention to the  explanation of how a catalyst affects the changes to the potential energy in a  chemical system as a reaction occurs. </p>

    <strong> SC 1.</strong>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 1. </strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Development of  catalysts has primarily occurred using empirical knowledge involving  investigations that appear to try conditions and identify changes needed to improve  the reaction rate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 2.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      The catalytic  converter and catalytic cracking towers in petroleum refining are examples of  technological inventions that involved the use of catalysts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 3. </strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Photosynthesis,  fermentation, and cellular respiration are natural (biological) processes that  involve the use of catalysts. Many other examples exist as most biological  reactions involve the use of enzymes as a catalyst.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 4.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Since enzymes are a  type of catalyst they are not changed by the chemical reaction. Since enzymes  catalyze many reactions, they do not have to be present in large numbers to  improve the efficiency of a chemical process in the body. If poisoned, the  reaction rate will be dramatically affected since very few enzyme molecules  exist. The resulting rate of reaction will be dramatically reduced due to fewer  catalyzed reactions.</p>

<p>You might wonder how catalysts are able to reduce the activation energy, which increases the rate of a chemical reaction, and still not be consumed in the process.  Read the section &ldquo;Theoretical Explanation of Catalysts&rdquo; on pages 536&ndash;538 in the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect  catalysts have on chemical systems is of great importance to many industries. Read  the sections &ldquo;Catalysts and the Nature of Science&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uses of Catalysts&rdquo; on  page 538&ndash;541 in the textbook.</p>

<strong>SC 3.</strong> To determine the desirability of burning biodiesel it may be necessary to consider the activation energy of its components, as this may help determine biodiesel&rsquo;s ease of combustion.  Biodiesel is a renewable energy source if it comes from plant sources; using biodiesel as an energy source will not have the same adverse effects as using fossil fuels.
