<p>As you researched the performance of biodiesel in the previous
lesson, did you come across personal accounts from people who have been
making and using biodiesel in their own automobiles? You probably came
across information that identifies the importance of using a strong
base&#8212;a hydroxide&#8212;when preparing biodiesel. Why is sodium hydroxide, or
alternatively potassium hydroxide, essential to making biodiesel? As
you will learn in this lesson, these compounds act as catalysts in the
chemical reaction that produces biodiesel. Catalysts are the focus of
this lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 3:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a catalyst?</li>
  <li>How does a catalyst influence a chemical reaction? </li>
</ul>

<p>In the Lesson 3 assignment you will design a laboratory
investigation to compare catalysts used in the preparation of
biodiesel. Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m2_l03_assign.doc"
