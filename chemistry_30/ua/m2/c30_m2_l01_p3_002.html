<h6>Lesson 1 Lab: Part 2&mdash;Testing Biodiesel (Determining the Energy Content of Biodiesel)</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Purpose </strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section you will compare the energy content of the biodiesel created in   Part 1 of this investigation with methanol and the oil used in its   preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>three 25 &times; 200-mm test tubes</li>
  <li>distilled water</li>
  <li>vegetable oil (used as a reactant in Part 1)</li>
  <li>methanol (the alcohol used in Part 1)</li>
  <li>biodiesel (produced from vegetable oil in Part 1)</li>
  <li>three spirit burners</li>
  <li>test-tube clamp and stand</li>
  <li>thermometer and clamp</li>
  <li>safety goggles, gloves, and apron</li>
  <li>50-mL graduated cylinder</li>
  <li>matches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use an electronic balance to measure the mass of three spirit burners containing the following three fuels: vegetable oil, methanol, and biodiesel (prepared in Part 1). Record the mass of each burner in a data table of your own construction.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use a graduated cylinder to measure 30.0 mL of distilled water, and transfer the water to a <span class="nowrap">25 &times; 200-mm</span> test tube. Place the test tube in a test-tube clamp attached to a stand. (Note: Use the approximation that 1 mL of water has a mass of 1.0 g.)<br />
  <br /> 
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Position the test tube so that the bottom of the test tube is 2 cm above the wick of the unreacted spirit burner containing the vegetable oil.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Step 4: </strong>Use a thermometer to measure the initial temperature of water inside the test tube. Record the initial temperature of the water.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Light the wick of the spirit burner and use the flame to heat the bottom of the test tube for 60 seconds.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Remove the spirit burner from underneath the test tube, and use the burner lid to extinguish the flame.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Use the thermometer to measure the final temperature of the water. Record the temperature.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Measure the mass of the spirit burner, and record the value.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Repeat Steps 2 through 8 using a new test tube with water and the spirit burner containing the alcohol.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Repeat Steps 2 through 8 using a new test tube with water and the spirit burner containing the biodiesel produced in Part 1 of the project. </p>
