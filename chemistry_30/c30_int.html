When you want to show your friends or family what you&rsquo;ve been learning, your work is all there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be expected to put all of your work into the course folder. If you are unsure of the process, your teacher will walk you through it. Throughout the course you will be asked to add things to the  course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to being able to show others what you have done, the course folder lets you see your progress. It lets you see how your knowledge, skills, and understandings are growing. It also lets you review  and annotate work you have already completed. You may find your course folder useful in preparing for tests and quizzes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Periodically, you will be asked to share items from your course folder with your teacher. This is not always for grading, as often  your teacher may use these items to learn more about you and your interests or as a way of tailoring other work  assigned to you.</p>
