<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of this lesson you were asked whether the proposed  reaction between nitric acid in acid deposition would be neutralized by  carbonate ions present in soil. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your understanding of predicting  acid-base reactions and  equilibrium position to determine whether nitric  acid and the other acids responsible for acid deposition (nitrous, sulfuric,  and sulfurous acids) would also be neutralized by carbonate ions present in  soil.</p>

<p>Save your work in your course folder. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson  1 you started summaries of your previous learning about acids and bases.  Update your summaries to include concepts you learned in  this lesson. You may wish to start a new summary for the new skill you learned in this lesson&mdash;predicting acid-base reactions.  Save a copy of your updated summaries in your course folder. You  may be asked to submit a copy to your teacher for feedback.</p>
