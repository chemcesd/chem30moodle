<p>The pH of solutions  provides important information about the equilibrium of acidic and basic  solutes. In the previous lessons you used solution pH and molar concentration  of the solute to calculate a percent ionization. In Module 7 you learned about  equilibrium law and<em> K</em><span class="subscript"><em>c</em></span>, the equilibrium constant. Can  <em>K</em><span class="subscript"><em>c</em></span> be calculated for acidic and basic solutions? What would a difference in the value for the equilibrium constant  for two acids or bases tell you about their equilibrium?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may recall reading in the textbook that the pH 
  of rainwater is normally 5.5. The presence of 
  dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 
  the rain droplets results in the formation of 
  carbonic acid, which in turn ionizes to produce 
  hydronium ions. Why is the pH of rainwater expected to be 5.5?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you  will investigate the use of quantitative techniques to describe the equilibrium  of aqueous acids and bases. You will also  investigate how the equilibrium influences the  pH of both strong and weak acids and bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 5:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span>,<em> K</em><span class="subscript">b</span>, and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">w</span>?</li>
  <li>How do <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span> and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b</span> explain the position of the equilibrium of aqueous acids and bases?</li>
  <li>How are values for <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span> and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b</span> used to calculate the pH of solutions containing weak acids and bases?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no  assignment for this lesson. Because of the nature of this lesson, the questions that are not marked by the teacher 
  are very important.  You should make an effort to ensure that you are confident with the calculations necessary to complete the work in this lesson before you proceed to Lesson 6. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions  that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with  the practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
