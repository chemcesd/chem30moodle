<p>Acid rain is an environmental issue that has received much attention. However, rain is only one mechanism by which acidic material from the atmosphere can meet Earth&rsquo;s surface. Acid deposition is a broader term that refers to all forms of wet and dry deposits that have acidic properties. How can rain, snow, and even dust become acidic? Can you recall the  chemical reaction that produces the acidic particle, the hydronium ion, and explains the properties of acids?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four acids have  been implicated in acid deposition. The four acids  include  nitrous and nitric acids, from  emissions of nitrous oxides, and sulfurous and sulfuric acids, from emissions of  sulfur oxides. Are there any differences  in properties among these four acids? Which of these acids poses the greatest  risk to the environment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your previous chemistry course you learned about the concept of weak and strong acids. How does this classification relate to the chemical reaction described above and its equilibrium? Which of the four acids are categorized as strong? Which are categorized  as weak? How might the 
  classification of these substances explain their effects on the environment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 2: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How is knowledge of equilibrium used to explain the differences in acid strength?</li>
</ul>
