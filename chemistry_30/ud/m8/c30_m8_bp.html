<p>Soil is often overlooked  when we think of important parts of Earth. In earlier science courses you learned  that soil is a component of the biosphere, the section of Earth that  supports life. Apart from being the medium for growing most plants, soil is the  home for many organisms. Soil is also made up of many chemical components. The  minerals, organic materials, and water within soil form a complex chemical  system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atmosphere also forms a  system in which equilibria can exist. How might these equilibria affect the rain and other  forms of precipitation that will deposit on Earth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 7 you learned that  certain combinations of chemicals can form an equilibrium system. You also  learned that equilibrium systems exhibit certain unique properties that can be  manipulated by the application of a stress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kinds of stresses are placed  on soil? Does human activity or agricultural practice affect the equilibrium of  chemical components in soil? How would the chemical components in soil respond  to the application of a stress, and what impact might that stress have on soil&rsquo;s  fertility?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soil is not the only system  that has chemical components that form an equilibrium system. In this module  you will also investigate the components within biological systems that make up equilibrium systems within organisms.</p>

<p><br />
  Each lesson contains a range of activities and assessment options. These include   assignments, labs, and Self-Check, Try This, Discuss, Reflect and Connect, and   Reflect on the Big Picture activities. Instructions will be provided for each of   these activities so that you can appropriately focus your time and effort. Your   teacher will tell you which assessment options to complete and which responses   to submit for marks or feedback. Remember to save all of your work in your   Chemistry 30 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Module 8 Assessment you will consider the construction of the Table of Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases, which you will use throughout this  module. You may wish to look at the Module Assessment and the Unit Assessment before   starting Lesson 1.</p>
