<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How is knowledge of the equilibrium of aqueous systems involved in predicting the outcome of acid-base reactions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of this  lesson has been on developing and testing a method to predict acid-base  reactions and the position of their equilibrium. You learned the principles upon which this method of prediction is based, and you tested  predictions by completing a virtual  investigation. You also considered how an understanding of this method could be  applied to investigating the action of soil components against acid deposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowledge of this  method is required to complete the rest of Module 8. In the next few lessons you will further your understanding of acid-base equilibrium by investigating the chemical reaction occurring in a titration and  the composition and action of chemical buffers.</p>
