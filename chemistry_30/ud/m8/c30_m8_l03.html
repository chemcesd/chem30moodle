<p>The concept of acids you currently work with involves a reaction with  water to produce hydronium ions. As you know from  earlier in this  module, bases dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. Those descriptions work  well for substances like hydrochloric acid and calcium hydroxide, but how do  you explain the acidic properties of the ammonium ion and the basic properties  of the carbonate ion? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ammonium is commonly used in nitrogen-based fertilizers, and carbonate is  one of many chemical components in soil&mdash;especially soils in Alberta. What is necessary to better understand the  acidic and basic properties of these substances? Would this understanding  help you  to predict changes that might occur to soil  as a result of soil management?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 3:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What occurs during a chemical reaction between an acid and a base?</li>
  <li>How does the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory support what is known about the equilibrium of aqueous acids and bases?</li>
  <li>How do conjugate acid-base pairs form an equilibrium system?</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no  assignment for this lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback  that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all  the questions and place those answers in your course folder.</p>
