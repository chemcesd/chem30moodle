    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Think back to the Module 8 Big Picture, which discussed examples of equilibrium in the soil, water, and atmosphere. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The combustion process that occurs in  automobile engines and furnaces produces nitrous oxides, NO(g) and NO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g). The following unbalanced series of reactions describes the deposition of nitric acid as a result of the chemical joining of nitrogen and oxygen that occurs during a combustion reaction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + 180 kJ   <img src="../../images/m8/m8_equations/eqn009.gif" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" /> 2 NO <img src="../../images/m8/m8_equations/eqn009.gif" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" />  NO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) <img src="../../images/m8/m8_equations/eqn009.gif" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" /> HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>(g) &rarr; deposition</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use your knowledge of equilibrium to explain how the energy from  high-temperature combustion processes contributes to the production of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>(g).  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Save a copy of your response in your course folder. You will further evaluate your answer later in this module.</p>

  <p>In Lesson  1 you  initiated a summary about the strength  of acids and bases. Take this opportunity to update your summary to include concepts you   learned in this lesson. Save a copy of your updated summary in your course  folder. You may be asked to submit a copy of this summary to your teacher for  feedback.</p>
