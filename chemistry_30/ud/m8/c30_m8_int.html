<h4>Module Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 7 you learned  about chemical equilibrium. In this module you will apply your understanding of the principles of equilibrium to  chemical systems containing  aqueous acids and bases. You will use your knowledge of dynamic equilibrium, equilibrium  position, and shifts in equilibrium. You will also rely on your ability to analyze an equilibrium  system using quantitative techniques (like calculating a value for the  equilibrium constant, <em>K<span class="subscript">c</span></em>) and your ability to complete an ICE table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your study of the equilibrium of aqueous 
  acids and bases will include an investigation of 
  environmental and biological systems. You will investigate how the components of these systems can interact to form 
  equilibrium systems,  and you will consider how the behaviour of these systems can 
  be better understood through knowledge of the 
  principles of chemical equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 8 you will investigate the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does the  equilibrium of acids and bases affect environmental and biological systems?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Modules 5 and 6 you used  a Table of Selected Standard Electrode Potentials to analyze redox systems. The  Module 8 Assessment will require you to consider the construction of the  Table of Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases, which you will use throughout this  module. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that each lesson will also be organized around questions intended to guide your study. As you proceed through Module 8, you may record answers to these questions and any interrelationships that exist between them in a concept map or graphic organizer. More information is available in the <a href="../c30_ud_org.html" target="_blank">Unit D Concept Organizer</a>. In the Module 8 Summary you will receive further information on how you can use your concept map or graphic organizer to review the concepts you studied in this module.</p>
