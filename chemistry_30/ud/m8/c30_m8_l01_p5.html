<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is the hydronium ion and how does it account for the properties of acidic solutions?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What chemical components are part of the equilibrium of water?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How does the equilibrium of water affect the calculation of pH?</li>
</ul>
<p>You  learned that pure water is a chemical system with an equilibrium between  hydronium ions and hydroxide ions, albeit at extremely low concentrations. You used  the water ionization constant to calculate the molar  concentrations of [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)]  and [OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)] that exist within water as a result of water&rsquo;s equilibrium. You also  reviewed the calculation of pH and pOH, further incorporating your knowledge of  the equilibrium of water. </p>
