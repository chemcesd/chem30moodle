<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson  Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What occurs during a chemical reaction between an acid and a base?</li>
  <li>How does the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory support what is known about the equilibrium of aqueous acids and bases?</li>
  <li>How do conjugate acid-base pairs form an equilibrium system?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry  concept states that acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton  acceptors during chemical reactions. This concept explains the  observations of acidic or basic properties of substances that previous theories could not explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further empirical  evidence to support this concept comes from the changes to pH that occur  during some chemical reactions. These changes can only be explained if it is assumed that a proton transfer has occurred between reacting species. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you learned  to consider a Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry reaction in terms of conjugate pairs of acids and  bases, and you learned  about the potential of these systems to act in equilibrium.</p>
