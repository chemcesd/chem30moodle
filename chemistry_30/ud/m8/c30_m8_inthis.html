<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 8&mdash;Acid-Base Equilibrium </h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Introduction to the  Equilibrium of Acids and Bases </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will be introduced to the equilibrium of acids and bases and the equilibrium of water. You will revisit the concepts of the hydronium ion and of the acidic particle. You will also recall  how hydronium ions are formed in aqueous solutions and are believed to be responsible for the properties of acidic solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is the hydronium ion and how does it account for the properties of acidic solutions?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What chemical components are part of the equilibrium of water?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How does the equilibrium of water affect the calculation of pH?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Acid Strength and Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acids can be classified as either strong acids or weak acids. In Lesson 2 you will apply your  understanding of equilibrium to investigate the strength of acids. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How is knowledge of equilibrium used to explain the differences in acid strength?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry Theory</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you will  learn about the development of the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory. The Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory explains the  chemical behaviour of acids and bases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What occurs during a chemical reaction between an acid and a base?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How does the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory support what is known about the equilibrium of aqueous acids and bases?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How do conjugate acid-base pairs represent an equilibrium system?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Predicting AB  Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you will test  a method to predict the equilibrium position for acid-base reactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How is knowledge of the equilibrium of aqueous systems involved in predicting the outcome of acid-base reactions?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Equilibrium Law and  the Strength of Acids and Bases </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you will investigate  the use of quantitative techniques to describe the equilibrium of aqueous acids  and bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span>, <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b</span>, and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">w</span>?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How do <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span> and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b</span> explain the position of the equilibrium of aqueous acids and bases?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How are values for <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span> and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b </span>used to calculate the pH of solutions containing weak acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 6&mdash;pH Curves</h5>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>In Lesson 6 you will  review acid-base titrations, and you will investigate the parts of a pH curve that  demonstrate behaviour as equilibrium systems. You will also learn about acidic  and basic substances that can react multiple times and how this process appears  on a pH curve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What information about acids and bases and their equilibrium is contained on a titration curve?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What events occur in the reaction of polyprotic acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 7&mdash;Buffers</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 7 you will investigate  the properties of buffers as equilibrium systems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a buffer and how does a buffer exhibit the characteristics of an equilibrium system?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What is buffering capacity?</li>
</ul>
