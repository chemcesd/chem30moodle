<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 7 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a buffer and how does a buffer exhibit the characteristics of an equilibrium system?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What is buffering capacity?</li>
</ul>
<p>You learned that buffers are  chemical systems composed of a weak acid and its conjugate base. If these  components are mixed in distinct proportions, a buffer with a specified pH can  be produced. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buffers act to maintain the pH of a system despite the addition of acid  or base but, because they are composed of chemical substances with definite  chemical amounts, there is a limit to the ability of a buffer to relieve a  stress if excessive chemical amounts are added. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed to the Module 8 Assessment, which also serves as your Unit D Assessment. </p>
