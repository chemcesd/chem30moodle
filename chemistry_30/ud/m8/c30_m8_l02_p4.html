  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following question:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>How is knowledge of equilibrium used to explain the differences in acid strength?</li>
</ul>
  <p>Acids can be  classified as either strong  or weak as a result of their ionization,  which produces hydronium ions. Strong acids ionize completely. You can consider  the concentration of hydronium ions that results from a strong acid&rsquo;s ionization to be  equal to the initial concentration of the acid present in the solution. Weak  acids ionize to a small extent. In the case of weak acids, the extent of ionization must be determined  or known in order to predict the resulting concentration of hydronium ions. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Knowledge of equilibrium allows for a description of the ionization of strong  and weak acids and for a calculation of the acid&rsquo;s percentage ionization. In Lesson 5 you will further study the  equilibrium of strong and weak acids using the equilibrium lab and the  ionization constant for acids.</p>
