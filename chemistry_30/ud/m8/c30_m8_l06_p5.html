<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson  Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What information about acids and bases and their equilibrium is contained on a titration curve?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What events occur in the reaction of polyprotic acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<p>You expanded upon your understanding of pH curves you began in your previous chemistry course when you graphed the change in pH against the volume of titrant added. Your work here has helped you to read  important information on a pH curve, including the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>whether the substance being titrated is an acid or a base<br />
  </li>
  <li>whether the substance being titrated is a strong or weak acid or base<br />
  </li>
  <li>whether the substance being titrated is monoprotic or polyprotic</li>
</ul>
<p>With this type of  information you are able to comment on the characteristics of the acid or base  being studied. If necessary, you can also design appropriate experiments for further  study of the acid or base under consideration.</p>
