<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module builds on your knowledge of acids and bases gained from previous  chemistry courses. You may wish to review the following parts of the textbook to prepare for the remainder of your study in this module: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The Nature of Acidic and Basic Solutions,&rdquo; page 236<br />
  </li>
  <li>various content about the hydronium ion, page 237 <br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;pH and pOH Calculations,&rdquo; pages 238&ndash;244<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Acid&ndash;Base Indicators,&rdquo; page 245<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;The Strength of Acids and Bases,&rdquo; pages 254&ndash;257<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Explaining Acids and Bases,&rdquo; pages 248&ndash;251<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Polyprotic Substances,&rdquo; page 258<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Titration Analysis,&rdquo; pages 328&ndash;330<br />
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Acid-Base Titration Curves and Indicators,&rdquo; pages 333&ndash;336</li>
</ul>
<p>Not in the mood for all that reading? Try entering the word &ldquo;video&rdquo; with each of the terms in the bullet list in an Internet search. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how you choose to review these concepts, keep a summary of relevant reactions and 
  concepts  for each topic. 
  Your summary for each topic might take the form of a  list, outline, concept map, or other form. Remember to add to your summaries as you work through this module.</p>

<p>In Chemistry 20 you learned about the existence of the  hydronium ion, H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq), the acidic particle in aqueous  solutions. The hydronium ion is produced by a chemical reaction in which a water  molecule becomes protonated. What process allows for a water particle to gain a  proton? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have hypothesized what would happen if two water molecules  were to collide. The resulting reaction would create species that would become part of an  equilibrium system within water. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 713&ndash;716 and work through &ldquo;Communication examples&rdquo; 1&ndash;4 of the  textbook to learn more about the equilibrium of water and its equilibrium  constant, <em>K</em><span class="subscript">w</span>.</p>
