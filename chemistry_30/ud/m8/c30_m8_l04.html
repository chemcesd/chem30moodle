<p>In Lesson 3 you learned about the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry concept. You were able to use this  principle to explain the chemical change occurring in an acid-base reaction.  However, this principle is not able to explain why certain acid-base  combinations will react and others will not. In this lesson you will  investigate how to predict the outcome of acid-base reactions and to determine  the equilibrium position for such reactions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the previous  lesson you investigated the reaction between carbonate ions found in soil and  nitric acid, which is responsible for acid deposition. You were able to identify  this reaction that might neutralize the nitric acid. However, with your current knowledge, you have no way to know whether  the reaction between the two components will occur when the components are mixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How is knowledge of the equilibrium of aqueous systems involved in predicting the outcome of acid-base reactions?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson you will begin to use the &ldquo;Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases at 298.15 K&rdquo; table located on pages 8 and 9 of the Chemistry Data Booklet.  You may recall that the Module 8 Assessment requires you to consider the structure of this table.  It may be helpful to review the Module 8 Assessment before you start this lesson.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you  will complete the lab &ldquo;Predicting Acid-Base Reactions.&rdquo; Download  a copy of the <a href="c30_m8_l04_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 8: Lesson 4 Assignment</a> to  your computer now. You will receive further instructions on how to complete  this assignment later in the lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions  that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with  the practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course.  You should respond to all of the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
