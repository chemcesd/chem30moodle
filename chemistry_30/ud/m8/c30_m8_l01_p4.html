  <p>Earlier in this lesson you learned that the salinity of soil affects plants&rsquo; ability to absorb water. In soils with high salinity, the large  concentration of chloride ions in the soil retains water, preventing the water from  being absorbed by plants.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Soil salinity is the result of the leaching of  chloride ions from salt formations beneath the surface and accumulations of the  solutes where water collects and evaporates. In  areas with high salinity, like the one shown in the photograph, a solubility equilibrium exists where salt precipitates  and dissolves depending on the availability of water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../icons/lab_icon_flask.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Complete the following investigation to analyze the solubility of  chloride ions in the equilibrium provided.</p>

  <p> Read &ldquo;Exploration: Salty Acid or Acidic Salt?&rdquo; on page 711 of the textbook. Then watch the virtual presentation &ldquo;<a href="https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/t4tes/courses/senior/chemistry_30/mm/m8/m8_l1_salty_acid/m8_l01_salty_acid.html" target="_blank">Exploration: Salty Acid or Acidic Salt?</a>&rdquo;</p>

      <li>Both solutions, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid, contain dissociated chloride ions. Therefore, there will be no reaction when the two solutions are mixed.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="a">
      <li>NaCl(aq) <img src="../../images/m7/m7_equations/eqilarrows.gif" alt="" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" /> Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3" type="a">
      <li><em>K</em><span class="subscript">c</span> = [Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)] [Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)]. Since the sodium chloride solution is saturated, all substances in the system have a constant concentration.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4" type="a">
      <li>When the concentrated hydrochloric acid was added, a white precipitate formed. It appears that the addition of  HCl(aq) shifts the equilibrium to the left, favouring the reverse reaction and allowing the formation of NaCl(s).</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="5" type="a">
      <li>The addition of HCl(aq) adds Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq) and some water to the system but does not add Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq). Therefore, the concentration of sodium ions decreases when HCl(aq) is added. This could be a stress on the system and, as predicted by Le Ch&acirc;tellier&rsquo;s principle, the forward reaction would be favoured (to increase the concentration of Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)). <br />
          <br />
        The result of this stress is a further increase in the concentration of chloride ions to a level that exceeds the concentration that is possible to remain dissolved. This situation favours the reverse reaction, and the precipitate of NaCl(s) forms.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="6" type="a">
      <li>The concentration of chloride ions in the concentrated hydrochloric acid must have been higher than the concentration of chloride ions in the saturated sodium chloride solution. Any other possibility would not have resulted in a situation that increased the concentration of Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq) past its maximum solubility.</li>
