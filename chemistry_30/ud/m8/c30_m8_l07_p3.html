<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can your knowledge of the equilibrium constant be used to estimate  the pH of a buffer solution? Considering that the chemical components in a  buffer include a weak acid and its conjugate base and water, would it be  possible to determine the pH of a buffer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Use the following  information to calculate the pH of a buffer composed of the following two  solutions: 0.200 mol/L ethanoic acid and 0.100 mol/L sodium ethanoate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acid deposition is  a constant stress on soil. Sometimes the quantity of acids deposited overwhelms the buffering capacity of soil, and the soil pH rapidly drops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Internet to  research the effect of loss of buffering capacity in soil on agricultural productivity. What strategies are used to restore the buffering capacity of soil? Do  these strategies make sense in light of what you have learned in Module 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save a copy of your research and your response in your course folder. </p>
