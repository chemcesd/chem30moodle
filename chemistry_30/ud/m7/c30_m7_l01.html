<p>It&rsquo;s one of the  last long weekends of the summer and you are spending the weekend beside a lake.  Unfortunately, a rain shower is approaching, and it looks like you will have to take a break from your lakeside  activities. Fortunately, there is plenty to do  inside the cabin with your friends. Maybe you will get a seat at the card game  that started a few hours ago. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not seem  immediately obvious, but systems at equilibrium are all around you. Can you  identify any systems at equilibrium in the situation described in the paragraph above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  To identify a  system at equilibrium, you have to know the characteristics that define equilibrium.  In this lesson you will begin to investigate equilibrium in chemical systems by  learning about the different types of equilibrium that can exist. You will also  learn the conditions that define a system at equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 1:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is equilibrium?</li>
  <li>What is happening in a system that is       in equilibrium?</li>
  <li>How can you determine       whether a system is open or closed? </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no  assignment for this lesson. However, you will begin a table to track the many chemical  systems  you will investigate and what you learn about their equilibrium. You will add to your table throughout Module 7, and you will use your  table to complete the Module Assessment. You will be prompted to begin your  table in the Reflect on the Big Picture activity towards the end of this  lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other questions in this lesson are not marked by the teacher; however, you should still answer these questions. The Self-Check, Try This, and other types of questions  are placed in this lesson to help you review important information and build key concepts that may be applied in future lessons. You  should record the answers to all the questions in the lesson and place those  answers in your course folder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a  discussion with your teacher, you must decide what to do with the questions  that are not part of your assignment. For example, you may decide to submit the responses to Try This and other questions that are not marked to your teacher for informal assessment and feedback. Your answers are very important to your teacher. They provide your teacher with information  about your learning, and they help your teacher identify where adjustments to your instruction may be necessary.</p>
