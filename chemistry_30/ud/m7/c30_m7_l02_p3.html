Module 7: Lesson 2 Lab&#8212;Evidence of Reverse Reaction </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Purpose</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your chemistry study to date, you have studied reactions that are
quantitative. What does a quantitative reaction mean? How does the term
<big style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><em style="font-weight: bold;">quantitative</em></big>
connect with what you are learning about equilibrium? In this virtual
investigation, you will observe the results of tests performed on a
chemical system to learn more about equilibrium.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>
Problem</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Can the products of the reverse reaction be detected in a chemical
system at equilibrium?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Experimental Design</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Refer to Investigation 15.1 on page 700 of your text.&nbsp; As you
read
the experimental design, you may wish to write out the
chemical reactions involved and determine what substance is being
tested for using Ba(NO<span class="subscript">3</span>)<span
 class="subscript">2</span>(aq). Contact your teacher if you are having
difficulty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four different volumes (25 mL, 50 mL, 75 mL, and 100 mL) of 0.50
mol/L CaCl<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq) are added to four 50-mL
aliquots of 0.50 mol/L Na<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span
 class="subscript">4</span>(aq). Each system is filtered and the mass
of precipitate produced is dried and measured. The filtrate from each
system is tested with a saturated solution of Ba(NO<span
 class="subscript">3</span>)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq).</p>
