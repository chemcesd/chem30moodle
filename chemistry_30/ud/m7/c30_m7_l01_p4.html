<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is equilibrium?</li>
  <li>What is happening in a system that is       in equilibrium?</li>
  <li>How can you determine       whether a system is open or closed? </li>
</ul>
<p>You  learned that equilibrium is defined as a system having constant properties and  appearing not to change. There are two main types of equilibrium: static equilibrium and  dynamic equilibrium. In a dynamic equilibrium there is a balance between two  opposing processes, the forward and reverse reactions, both occurring at the  same rate. You also learned to differentiate between a closed system and an open  system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You applied your  newly acquired knowledge to identify examples of  equilibrium systems. As you work through Module 7 you will continue to  examine these systems to describe their other attributes, and you will consider how these attributes are similar in  all equilibrium systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>closed system:</strong> a system that is separated from its  surroundings by a definite boundary so that energy can enter and leave the  system but matter cannot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic equilibrium:</strong> the idea that there is a balance between  two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the same rate </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balance between  the forward and reverse processes maintains the system&rsquo;s appearance of constant  properties, in spite of change that has occurred internally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>equilibrium:</strong> the state of a closed system in which&nbsp;the system does not appear to change&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a chemical system, physical properties,  like colour, remain constant and concentrations of substances within the system  do not change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>macroscopic:</strong> can be observed with the unaided eye or other  senses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>microscopic:</strong> cannot be observed with the unaided eye or  other senses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>open system:</strong> a system in which both matter and energy  can enter and leave the system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>static equilibrium:</strong> the idea that forces on an object are  opposing and equal </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The object remains  constant because no changes are happening internally.</p>
