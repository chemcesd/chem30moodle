<p>Did all four systems you examined in &#8220;Mini Investigation: Modelling
Dynamic Equilibrium&#8221; achieve an equilibrium? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you learned earlier, equilibrium in a chemical system exists when
the rates of the forward and reverse reactions equal. As you saw in
this investigation, the initial volume of reactant, relative to
product, was not important in establishing an equilibrium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important aspect of equilibrium is position of equilibrium.
The term <em>equal</em> brings to mind a teeter-totter balancing
parallel to the ground. If each side of the teeter-totter represents
the concentrations of reactant and products respectively, is a position
parallel to the ground the only position possible? If you think about
some of the other equilibrium systems you have investigated and
summarized in the table you have been keeping, does their equilibrium
represent equal concentrations of reactant and products?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the &#8220;Evidence of a Reverse Reaction&#8221; lab you completed in Lesson
2, you will recall that the equilibrium in that system involved a great
deal of calcium sulfate precipitate and an extremely small quantity of
dissociated sulfate ions, which were only detectable by the addition of
barium ions. This equilibrium clearly favoured the formation of the
products (forward reaction) and resulted in a situation in which the
concentration of the products was higher than that of the reactant
species. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systems that significantly favour the formation of products are
quantitative systems. You will recall from your work in Chemistry 20
that you were able to perform stoichiometric calculations on chemical
systems that had percentage reactions of over 99%. In these systems and
relative to the quantity of product, very little reactant remains once
equilibrium is established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the section &#8220;Chemical Reaction Equilibrium&#8221; on pages 678&#8211;680 in
the textbook to learn more about the different positions of equilibrium
in chemical systems.</p>

  <li>A system at equilibrium appears not to change, or has a constant
set of observable properties.<br>

  <li>An equilibrium involves a forward and a reverse reaction
occurring at equal rates. These two reactions involve change at the
microscopic level; because change occurs, the system is dynamic.<br>
