<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s principle and how is it used  to predict changes in chemical equilibrium systems?</li>
</ul>
<p>Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s principle  describes how chemical systems at equilibrium react to stresses such as changes  in concentration of species in the system, change to  temperature, and changes  in the volume (pressure) of the system. Equilibrium systems undergo a shift to  a new equilibrium by either favouring the forward or the reverse reaction. In  this lesson you learned how to identify a stress placed on a system, the  component in the system affected by the stress, and the most likely action by  the system to counteract the stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Proceed to the  Module Assessment where you will have the opportunity to apply your  understanding of Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s principle and some of the other aspects of  equilibrium you have learned in Module 7.</p>
