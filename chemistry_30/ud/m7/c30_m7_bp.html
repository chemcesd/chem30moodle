<p>In the Module Introduction you read that there are examples of equilibrium  all around you. You are probably questioning whether this is true. In this module you will be introduced to a number of chemical systems in which equilibrium is critical to each system&rsquo;s function. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studying equilibrium is not only a matter of knowing the system; studying equilibrium also involves knowing the changes that can occur within the system that help to describe the equilibrium.  In your study you will learn about forward and reverse reactions, conditions, and stresses; all of which define a chemical equilibrium. You will do more than study the basic principles of a system at equilibrium;  you will learn how manipulating conditions can allow you to understand a chemical equilibrium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep detailed notes. You will use your notes to complete the Module Assessment. In Reflect on the Big Picture activities at the end of each lesson, you will be prompted to construct and add to a table that lists the different systems you investigate.  As you update your table you will revisit the concepts you learned in previous lessons, and you will apply that knowledge to new systems.  This is a great way to keep using the knowledge you gain in each lesson.  You will also be able to use this table to prepare for assessments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Assessment in This Module </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Each  lesson contains a range of activities and assessment options. These include assignments, labs,  and Self-Check, Try This, Discuss, Reflect and Connect, and Reflect on the Big Picture activities. Instructions will be provided for each of these activities so that you can appropriately focus your time and effort. Your teacher will tell you  which assessment options to complete, and which responses to submit for marks or  feedback. Remember to save all of your work in your Chemistry 30 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the Module 7 Assessment you will analyze an equilibrium system, and you will design an experiment to further investigate the factors that influence its equilibrium. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> More information  is provided in  the Module  Assessment. You may wish to look at the Module Assessment and the Unit Assessment before starting Lesson 1.</p>
