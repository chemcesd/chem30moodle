<p>In Lesson 3, you  completed a series of calculations to determine the percent yield to analyze  the following system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  CH<span class="subscript">4</span>(g) +  Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) <img src="../../images/m7/m7_equations/Eqil arrows.gif" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" /> CH<span class="subscript">3</span>Cl(g) + HCl(g)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial quantity of  CH<span class="subscript">4</span>(g) = 2.00 mol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Quantity of CH<span class="subscript">3</span>Cl(g)  = 1.40 mol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 1.</strong> Calculate the  quantity of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>(g) that reacted and that remains unreacted. Explain  how you completed these calculations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Recall that 10.00 mol of chlorine were  placed into the system initially. Could the process you explained in SC 1 be  used to calculate the quantity of Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) and HCl(g) in the system at  equilibrium?</p>

    <p><strong>SC 1.</strong> Mole ratios can be used to complete the  calculation for quantity of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>(g) reacted. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../images/m7/m7_equations/eqn032.gif" width="366" height="65" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The moles  of methane that reacted were 1.40 mol.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>  The quantity of  methane remaining is 2.00 mol &minus; 1.40 mol = 0.60 mol.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Using mole ratios will allow the  calculation of the remaining substances. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>  Moles of chlorine  reacted will be equal to the moles of methane that reacted, since they combine  in 1:1 proportions. Therefore, moles of Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) reacted = 1.40 mol  and moles of Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) remaining is 10.00 mol &ndash;1.40 mol = 8.60 mol.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>  Moles of HCl(g)  produced will be equal to moles of cloromethane produced, since the reactants  have 1:1 proportions (as shown in the balanced chemical equation). Therefore,  moles of HCl(g) = 1.40 mol.</p>

<p>The process you  described in your answers to SC 1 and SC 2 requires you to apply your knowledge of  stoichiometry to a new situation. You know the quantity of one of the  products and one of the reactants, and you have a balanced chemical equation. It  is possible to use this information and the ratios of coefficients between  species to determine the quantities of the other substances in the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using changes in chemical quantities of substances in a system as it approaches equilibrium  can be summarized using a structure called an ICE table. To read more about an ICE table and to learn how the calculations you performed are used in its completion, read page 681 in the textbook and work through &ldquo;Sample problem 15.1.&rdquo;  As you work through the sample problem, note how the stoichiometric ratios are applied to the change in concentration for each species in the system.</p>

<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> What do the letters in ICE represent?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 4.</strong> Why is the value for the change in the quantity  of each species important in completing an ICE table? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 5.</strong> What does a negative sign in the change row  of an ICE table represent?</p>

    <p><strong>SC 3. </strong>I = initial, C = change, and E = equilibrium  concentrations of reactants and products in the equilibrium system.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 4. </strong>The change in  concentration of each species is an important value to have because it  identifies the quantity of substance that has undergone chemical change as  equilibrium has been established. In a system at equilibrium, some quantity of  each species in the system will be present; therefore, the change in quantity  for one substance is required to interpret the change in quantity for other  substances in the system.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 5.</strong> A negative sign represents a decrease in  quantity for that substance. A decrease in chemical quantity or moles for reactants is expected since reactants are  consumed by the forward reaction as the system establishes equilibrium.</p>
