<strong>Analysis</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> For each of Tubes 2&#8211;5, indicate which
substance, Co(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O)<span class="subscript">6</span><span
 class="superscript">2+</span> or CoCl<span class="subscript">4</span><span
 class="superscript">2&#8211;</span>, increases in concentration as a result
of the manipulation performed on the tube during the demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Suggest an explanation for the colour changes
you observe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save a record of your observations and answers in your course
folder. Throughout this lesson you will review your observations and
consolidate your understanding of the principles introduced and
developed throughout Lesson 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the demonstration you just completed, you saw that changing the
conditions for a chemical system equilibrium causes a change to the
equilibrium. In the demonstration, a colour change was distinct
evidence that a shift in the position of an equilibrium had occurred.
In your analysis of the observation, you were asked to identify which
coloured species, Co(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O)<span
 class="subscript">6</span><span class="superscript">2+</span> or CoCl<span
 class="subscript">4</span><span class="superscript">2</span>,
increased in concentration as a result of the change in conditions on
that system.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> How can the concentration of one of these substances change? <big

pages 691&#8211;693 in the textbook to begin to address this question.</span></big></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le Ch&acirc;telier&#8217;s principle describes a response by a chemical
system at equilibrium that has been disturbed. This principle states
that when a chemical equilibrium is disturbed, the system seems to
respond in the direction that opposes the change (consumes or
counteracts the stress). This principle allows you to predict the
direction of the shift in the equilibrium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><img src="../icons/discuss.gif" width="35" height="31"> DO THIS </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the virtual investigation &#8220;Demonstration of Equilibrium Shifts,&#8221;
you observed the effect of changing the concentration and temperature
on the system being studied. Can you explain the colour change you
observed in each of the tubes tested using Le Ch&acirc;telier&#8217;s
principle? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DO 1.</strong> Retrieve your observations and answers to TR
1 and TR 2. Review the changes that occurred in each tube, and write an
explanation for the change observed that demonstrates an understanding
of Le Ch&acirc;telier&#8217;s principle. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make
sure your explanation for the change that occurred in each tube
explicitly identifies the following points:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>the &#8220;stress&#8221; placed on the system</li>
  <li>which reaction, the forward or the reverse, is favoured to
respond to the stress</li>
  <li>how favouring the forward or reverse reaction serves to
counteract the stress</li>
  <li>the direction of the equilibrium shift</li>
</ul>
