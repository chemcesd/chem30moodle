<p>What defines an <strong>equilibrium</strong>? You may be surprised
to learn that an equilibrium is defined as a system that has constant
properties and appears not to change. In the lakeside example from Get
Focused, the water level of the lake and the quantity of oxygen
dissolved in the lake&#8217;s water are two examples of equilibria that
exist. Can you think of other examples of systems around you that
appear not to change and may be equilibrium systems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reconsider the example of the lakeside cabin. Either during a
rainstorm or at night when all your friends have come inside and no one
leaves or enters, an equilibrium has established in the cabin. The
equilibium has established because the number of people in the cabin
remains constant. Because no one can come or go, the system (the cabin
and its occupants) is a <strong>closed system</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equilibrium can appear in one of two ways: as a <strong>static
equilibrium</strong> or as a <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the evening, the position of people inside the cabin could
resemble a dynamic equilibrium. This would be true if the number of
people playing cards inside the cabin, at any given time, were to
remain the same. Over the evening, people could enter and leave the
card game, but the number of people at the table at any given time
would have to remain constant. As you can see from this example, in a
dynamic equilibrium there is a change, but the change is balanced by
two processes. In this example the balance is with the number of people
entering and leaving the card game; for every person that enters, one
person must leave so that the number of people in the game remains
constant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left4blockD">
<p><strong>equilibrium:</strong> the state of a closed system in
which&nbsp;the system does not appear to change&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a chemical system, physical properties, like colour, remain
constant and concentrations of substances within the system do not
change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>static equilibrium:</strong> the idea that forces on an
object are opposing and equal </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The object remains constant because no changes are happening
internally. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic equilibrium:</strong> the idea that there is a
balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring
at the same rate </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balance between the forward and reverse processes maintains the
system&#8217;s appearance of constant properties, in spite of change that has
occurred internally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>closed system:</strong> a system that is separated from its
surroundings by a definite boundary so that energy can enter and leave
the system but matter cannot </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>macroscopic:</strong> can be observed with the unaided eye
or other senses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>microscopic:</strong> cannot be observed with the unaided
eye or other senses </p>
</div>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now consider the lakeside cottage system more broadly. Consider the
closed system to include the cabin, its immediate surroundings, and the
number of people not only in the cabin, but in the immediate
surroundings as well. In this broader system, no one comes or goes. As
such, it is a static system. In the example of this broader system, it
would be possible to have a change in <strong>microscopic</strong>
properties without having a change in <strong>macroscopic</strong>
properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that these examples describe not only
static and dynamic equilibrium, but they also describe two different
equilibrium states. For example, the number of people expected to be in
the cabin when the weather is sunny, is much different than it would be
during a rainstorm or at night. Each of these situations is an
equilibrium because of the observation of a constant number of people
inside the cabin. However, these two equilibrium states are different.
Can you think of a reason to account for the difference between the two
equilibrium states? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All systems, including those at equilibrium, are influenced by
external forces and conditions. Both rain and night are conditions that
appear to encourage people to congregate inside the cabin. Under these
conditions you can expect one equilibrium state. When the conditions
change, so can the equilibrium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockD">
<p><strong>open system:</strong> a system in which both matter and
energy can enter and leave the system </p>
</div>
<p>Can you predict what might happen to the equilibrium situation of
people in the cabin if you expect more friends to arrive throughout the
day? As you might expect, adding more people means that your system is
no longer closed. An <strong>open system</strong> is one in which
matter can be exchanged with its surroundings. In an open system it is
much more difficult to predict changes in equilibrium, since it is more
difficult to isolate the matter you wish to study.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>TR 1. </strong>Which reaction(s) proceeded to completion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2. </strong>How did you describe whether a reaction
proceeded to completion in the chemical equations you wrote? How did
you describe a reaction that did not appear to be complete?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong>Which system(s) demonstrated that an
equilibrium had been established? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Do All Reactions Go to Completion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reaction 1: 2 HCl(aq) + Mg(s) --&gt; MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reaction 2: methylene blue (reduced) + O2(g) --&gt; methylene blue
(oxidized)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong> Reaction 1 proceeded to completion.
Reaction 2 did not, as
evidenced by the loss of colour and return to the colour it was prior
to shaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2. </strong> See the reactions above. (The use of
double-sided arrows for
Reaction 2 is the most likely answer, followed by rewriting the reverse
reaction.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong> Both systems demonstrated aspects of
equilibrium, since both
systems eventually arrived at a constant set of macroscopic properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This may surprise you, but it is helpful to review the criteria
for a system at equilibrium. In later lessons the concept of an
equilibrium position will be explained.)
