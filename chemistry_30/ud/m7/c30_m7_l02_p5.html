<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a reverse reaction and why is it       important in an equilibrium system?</li>
  <li>What changes occur during dynamic       equilibrium?</li>
</ul>
<p>You learned  that there are three types of equilibrium for chemical systems: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Phase equilibrium: one chemical substance exists in more than one  phase in a closed system.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Solubility equilibrium: one solute and one solvent exist in a  saturated solution that has an excess of solute in a closed system.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Chemical reaction equilibrium: the reactants create products as  fast as the products create reactants; in other words, the  forward reaction is approximately equal to the reverse reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these types of equilibria is a dynamic equilibrium, meaning  that microscopic changes occur in the system as described by forward and  reverse reactions for the chemical components of the system. In this lesson you  completed an investigation to test for the products of the reverse reaction.  This investigation confirmed that this process occurs, even in conditions  involving stoichiometric excess.</p>
