          <h5>Module Glossary</h5>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>closed system:</strong> a system that is separated from its  surroundings by a definite boundary so that energy can enter and leave the  system but matter cannot</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>dynamic equilibrium:</strong> the idea that there is a balance between  two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the same rate </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The balance between  the forward and reverse processes maintains the system&rsquo;s appearance of constant  properties, in spite of change that has occurred internally.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>equilibrium:</strong> the state of a closed system in which&nbsp;the system does not appear to change&nbsp; </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For a chemical system, physical properties,  like colour, remain constant and concentrations of substances within the system  do not change.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>macroscopic:</strong> can be observed with the unaided eye or other  senses</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>microscopic:</strong> cannot be observed with the unaided eye or  other senses</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>open system:</strong> a system in which both matter and energy  can enter and leave the system</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>static equilibrium:</strong> the idea that forces on an object are  opposing and equal </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The object remains  constant because no changes are happening internally.</p>
