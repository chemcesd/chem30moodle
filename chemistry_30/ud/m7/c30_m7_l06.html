<p>It&#8217;s winter and time to get back into the competitive season. The
first few races of the snowboarding season are always so tough. Despite
training hard in the off-season, snowboarders always feel out of breath
and tired when in the mountains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This kind of experience is common for people who visit altitudes,
especially if they exert themselves through strenuous physical
activity. You may have noticed that people who live at high altitudes
do not seem to suffer from these symptoms. The human body&#8217;s ability to
adapt to living at altitude has attracted many athletes to live and
train in high-altitude locations or to purchase tents that simulate
high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the quantity of oxygen in the air at higher altitudes is
reduced as compared to lower altitudes, the human body has to respond
to this situation. If you live under these conditions for a prolonged
period of time, your body will produce more red blood cells, the blood
component responsible for oxygen transport. By producing more red blood
cells, your body can capture more of the oxygen from the air, thereby
providing your body with sufficient oxygen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you will learn about responses that occur in chemical
systems as a result of changes in the conditions they are within. The
change to conditions, often referred to as a stress, can change an
equilibrium. In this lesson you will investigate whether there is a way
to predict the response to a stress placed on a chemical system in an
equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 6:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is Le Ch&acirc;telier&#8217;s principle and how is it used to
predict changes in chemical equilibrium systems?</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The
assignment for this lesson is to hand in the completed table that you
created in Lesson one and continued to add to in lessons 2-6.&nbsp; </span><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by
the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and
feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You should
respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course
folder.</p>
