<p>When taking antibiotics, it is advised that you take the drug at regular  time intervals. Can you think of why it is important to take the drug at the  times specified? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for a drug to have its desired effect, it has to reach a certain  concentration in the body. This concentration can be regarded as an equilibrium  concentration, since the concentration is a result of the processes of ingestion and absorption   of the drug (which will increase the concentration) and the processes of  metabolism and excretion (which will decrease the concentration). Can you think  of how the processes to reach an equilibrium in the concentration of a medicine  in the body are similar to those in the investigation in which you simulated a dynamic equilibrium?&nbsp; </p>
