<p>When you brush your teeth you probably do so to remove harmful
plaque that can cause tooth decay. Did you realize that brushing your
teeth contributes to an equilibrium system? Most types of toothpaste
and dental rinse contain fluoride, an important component in the
process of building dental enamel&#8212;the outermost tooth layer made of
hydroxyapatite and fibrous protein. The layer of enamel is part of a
chemical equilibrium involving the processes of enamel formation and
erosion. The chemical equilibrium is shown in the reaction</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain why dentists often ask their patients to use
toothpastes and dental rinses containing fluoride? How would you
incorporate your understanding of equilibrium to explain this practice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you learned about the three types of chemical
equilibria. In Lesson 3 you will study chemical systems in equilibrium
in greater depth, and you will investigate the characteristics of these
systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are all equilibrium states similar?</li>
</ul>

<p>In your lesson assignment you will analyze a model of dynamic
equilibrium. Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m7_l03_assign.doc">Module
7: Lesson 3 Assignment</a> to your computer now. You will receive
further instructions on how to complete this assignment later in the
lesson. You will also receive further information on how to add to the
table you started in Lesson 1. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by
the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and
feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You should
respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course
folder.</p>
