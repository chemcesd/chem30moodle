<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 7&mdash;Principles of Chemical Equilibrium</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Introduction to Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will  learn about the two types of equilibrium and how to differentiate between them.  You will learn to identify the characteristics of chemical systems that are at equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is equilibrium?</li>
  <li>What is happening in a system that is in       equilibrium?</li>
  <li>How can you determine whether a system is open or       closed?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Dynamic Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you will  learn about the three types of equilibrium for chemical systems, and you will learn  to identify  forward and reverse processes in each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is a reverse reaction and why is it       important in an equilibrium system?</li>
  <li>What changes occur during dynamic equilibrium?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Position  of an Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you will  learn how an equilibrium can be established and what the relative proportions  of products to reactants can be in a system at equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Are all equilibrium states similar?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Quantitative  Perspectives of Equilibrium</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 4 you will learn to apply your skills in performing stoichiometric  calculations to analyze chemical systems in equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What procedures are       used to calculate the chemical quantities for all substances in a chemical       system?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;The  Equilibrium Constant</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 5 you will learn about the equilibrium constant and the equilibrium  law. The equilibrium law is an expression that relates the concentrations of  the products to the reactants in a chemical system. It is used to  calculate an equilibrium constant. You will come to understand how the value  for the equilibrium constant is used to communicate information about the  position of an equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is the equilibrium constant?</li>
  <li>What information about an equilibrium is       provided in an equilibrium constant?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 6&mdash;Le  Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s Principle</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you will learn how chemical systems at equilibrium react to the application of a stress.  The stress can be a change to the concentration of one of the species in the system, a change in the system&rsquo;s temperature, or a change in the volume (pressure) of the system. You will learn how to predict shifts in equilibrium and to identify the purpose of predicting and manipulating equilibrium by causing shifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the  following lesson question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s       principle and how is it used to predict changes in chemical equilibrium       systems?</li>
</ul>
