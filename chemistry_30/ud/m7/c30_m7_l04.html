<p>In your study of chemical equilibrium so far, you have observed colour changes.  In chemical systems in which a coloured substance is involved, colour changes indicate a change in the molar concentration of the coloured substance within the system.  Depending on the concentration of one coloured substance relative to other substances, the overall system&rsquo;s colour describes  the position of a system&rsquo;s equilibrium.  If the overall colour changes, it indicates that the equilibrium is changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using colour is not always the best way to describe the position of an equilibrium.  In Lesson 3 you determined the position of a chemical equilibrium system using percent reaction. To complete a calculation of percent yield, you require information about the chemical quantities of one reactant and one of the products in the system. If a chemical system involves many components, how can their chemical quantities be determined? What information about the system do these quantities provide?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determining the quantities of all the reactants and products in a system  is an important process in understanding a chemical equilibrium. In Lesson 4  you will learn a systematic procedure to better understand chemical equilibrium  from a quantitative perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 4: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What procedures are used to calculate the chemical  quantities for all substances in a chemical system?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no  assignment for this lesson. You will be assessed on the material you learn in  this lesson as part of the Lesson 5 Assignment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions  that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with  the practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course.  You should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
