<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 7&mdash;Principles of Chemical Equilibrium</h3>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Module Summary  </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 7 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>What is happening in a system at equilibrium?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do scientists predict shifts in the       equilibrium of a system?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The study of chemical equilibrium  has many applications. In this module you learned that chemical equilibrium is  an important process in biological and chemical systems. Knowledge of  chemical equilibrium is used in many areas, including environmental sciences,  chemistry, pharmacology, sports medicine, the chemical industry, and  engineering. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you were introduced  to the basic concepts of chemical equilibrium and to many applications in which knowledge of equilibrium helps to better understand the  function of these systems. You were introduced to many chemical systems that demonstrate  principles like position of equilibrium, equilibrium law, and Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s  principle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have kept track of the systems you investigated in a summary table. Now is a good time to use your table to review the concepts you  learned by studying the equilibrium systems.  Summaries like the table you constructed throughout this module can really help you prepare  for upcoming examinations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to continue to use a table like the one you used in Module 7 as you investigate acid and base systems and their equilibria in Module 8. 
  The fundamental aspects of chemical equilibrium you learned in Module 7 will be important for your study in Module 8.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 7 you may have added information to a concept   map or graphic organizer, based on the module and lesson questions listed in the   Module 7 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time to review the relationships in   your concept map or graphic organizer and try to answer the module and lesson   questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="c30_m7_sum_001.html" target="_blank">sample Module 7 concept map</a> shows one set of possible links between the   questions. Remember that this is one possible description only&mdash;there are many   other correct possibilities. However, if your completed concept map or graphic   organizer differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your   teacher or to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your   class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials, and your   descriptions, are accurate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the description of the following investigation and  view the virtual investigation. Next, complete the Analysis questions. Ensure that your answers include accurate descriptions and explicit  reference to the data provided. Remember to state interpretations made from  these data using proper representations of, and terminology for, the concepts  involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Describing a Chemical Equilibrium System</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An experiment was performed  to investigate the effect of an energy change on the following equilibrium  system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fe<span class="superscript">3+</span>(aq) + SCN<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq) <img src="../../images/m7/m7_equations/Eqil arrows.gif" width="17" height="14" align="absmiddle" /> FeSCN<span class="superscript">2+</span>(aq)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Experimental Design</strong></p>
<p><br />
  A colour change in the  substances involved will be used to determine whether a change in equilibrium occurs  when a test tube containing a mixture of the components in the system  is placed in a warm water bath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><br />
  <img src="../icons/watch_and_listen.gif" width="35" height="31" /> View the virtual investigation &ldquo;<a href="../../mm/m7/m7_l0_module_assessment/m7_l0_module_assessment.html" target="_blank">Describing a Chemical Equilibrium System</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the following questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Organize your observations from this investigation into a data table.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Explain the purpose of test tubes 1, 2, and 3 in the experimental design.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Does energy affect the equilibrium system investigated?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Write the chemical equation for this equilibrium system, including the term for energy in the equation.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What principle was used to investigate the equilibrium in this system? Explain how using this principle allowed you to make interpretations in your answer to question 4.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Describe one additional experiment that you could perform to confirm your analysis of this eqilibrium system. Include a description of the expected result and an explanation of how the expected result can be used to confirm your analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save your answers in your course folder and submit a copy to your teacher. </p>
