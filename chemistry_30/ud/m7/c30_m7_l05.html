<p>In Lesson 4 you considered the importance of maintaining the desired  concentration of a prescription drug in your system. Maintaining the concentration of a drug in a system involves many equilibria, including the rates at which the drug could be absorbed into your system and the rate at which the drug is metabolized and excreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pharmacologist studies the development and action of drugs in the body.  Consideration of equilibria is very important in the work of pharmacologists. Important  equilibria to consider in pharmacology include the solubility of the drug and  its ionization once in the system. These equilibria influence the ability of  the drug to be absorbed by the blood and to have its desired effect in the  body. How would a pharmacologist and other scientists study an equilibrium?  What sort of information is most useful to them? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will learn how to use numerical data, beyond the percentage reaction calculation performed in previous lessons,  to provide information about an equilibrium, including the equilibrium&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 5:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is  the equilibrium constant?</li>
  <li>What  information about an equilibrium is provided in an equilibrium constant?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your assignment  will address material covered in Lessons 4 and 5. Download  a copy of the <a href="c30_m7_l05_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 7: Lesson 5  Assignment</a> to  your computer now. You will receive further instructions on how to complete  this assignment later in the lesson. You will also receive further information on adding to the table you began in Lesson 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions  that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with  the practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course.  You should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
