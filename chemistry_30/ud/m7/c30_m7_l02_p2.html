<p>The Haber process to make ammonia provides an important example of
the importance of forward and reverse reactions in a chemical system. <br>

The problems encountered when trying to increase the yield of ammonia
are evidence that a reverse reaction is an important aspect of this
system. It can occur at the same instant as the forward reaction and in
the same reaction vessel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In designing a system to maximize the yield of ammonia,
experimentation with pressures, temperatures, and catalysts is intended
to favour the forward reaction so that large quantities of product can
be made. During unsuccessful trials, large quantities were not
achieved. In Lesson 6 you will learn more about conditions that may
favour the forward or reverse reaction. For now, it is important to
understand that both processes exist within a system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you learned that a system at equilibrium is a closed
system that has constant properties or does not appear to change. In
this lesson you have learned that an equilibrium also involves a
forward and a reverse reaction. How do all of these ideas connect? Use
the following activity to demonstrate your understanding of these
aspects of an equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the following statement to answer questions TR 1&#8211;3: A system at
equilibrium is a closed system that has constant properties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Interpret the statement by describing the
rate of reaction of the forward and reverse processes for a system that
is at equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Interpret the statement by describing the
rates of the forward and reverse reaction for a system that is
approaching equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Provide one observation to support your
answer to TR 2.</p>
