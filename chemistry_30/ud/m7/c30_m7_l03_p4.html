<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are all  equilibrium states similar?</li>
</ul>
<p>You completed a  simulation of a system demonstrating dynamic equilibrium. This investigation  helped you learn more about how an equilibrium can be established and what the  relative proportions of products to reactants can be in a system at  equilibrium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also learned  that there are four positions for an equilibrium involving a chemical system: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-spontaneous: these systems have no apparent reaction. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Products favoured: the equilibrium has a percent yield that is greater than 50%, where the products of the forward reaction are favoured. The outcome for such a system is that the  concentration of the products will be higher than that of the reactant species. You need to be able to differentiate this from what occurs when the system reaches its equilibrium and the rates of the forward and reverse reactions in the system are equal.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Reactants favoured: the equilibrium has a percent yield that is less than 50%, where the reactants of the forward reaction are favoured. The outcome for such a system is that the  concentration of the products will be lower than that of the reactant species.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Quantitative: the equilibrium has a percent yield that is  greater than 99%, where the products of the forward reaction are highly  favoured. </li>
</ul>
