<p> In your earlier investigations of equilibrium, you used colour
changes to monitor whether or not a system was at equilibrium. You will
recall that in an equilibrium, all species in the chemical system are
present to some extent. Therefore, the equilibrium you observed was a
mixture of colours of the reactant and product species. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending upon the position of the equilibrium, the colour may have
been more like the products or the reactants, but it was always a
blending of colours from each group. You also know from your
understanding of solutions that colour intensity is directly related to
concentration. For example, the higher the concentration of the
oxidized form of methylene blue, the more intense the blue colour of
the solution in the flask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what you have learned so far in this module, you know that some
relationships regarding equilibrium are important and need to be
considered in any calculation for an equilibrium constant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep the following three important relationships in an equilibrium
in mind when calculating an equilibrium constant:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The concentrations of each species in the system are important
values.</li>
  <li>The position of an equilibrium is determined by the relative
proportions of products to reactants.</li>
  <li>A balanced chemical equation describes the proportions of
reactants and products involved in the system.</li>
</ul>
