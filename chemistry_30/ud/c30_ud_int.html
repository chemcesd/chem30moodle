<p>Unit D  is dedicated to a  study of chemical equilibrium. In Module 7 you will investigate the principles  of chemical equilibrium. In Module 8 you will expand upon these principles as you investigate the  equilibrium of acid-base systems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout Unit D  you will rely on your skills as an observer, and you will develop skills to predict changes that may occur to equilibrium systems.  As you have done in other units in this course, you will also rely on your knowledge of diagnostic tests to check your predictions and to confirm you understanding of principles affecting chemical equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will learn to describe and analyze equilibrium systems from a range of perspectives. In addition to qualitative  descriptions, you will describe equilibrium systems from a quantitative  perspective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 7 you will use ICE tables and the equilibrium constant, <em>K</em><span class="subscript"><em>c</em></span>, to describe an equilibrium from  a quantitative perspective. You will  further apply this understanding in Module 8 using the equilibrium constants  for acids and bases, <em>K</em><span class="subscript">a</span> and <em>K</em><span class="subscript">b</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of Unit D you will be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>explain that there is a balance of opposing reactions in  chemical equilibrium systems<br />
  </li>
  <li>determine quantitative relationships in simple equilibrium systems</li>
</ul>
<p>The Module 8 Assessment will  also serve as your Unit D Assessment. In the Assessment, you will investigate the principles  involved in the design and structure of the Table of Relative Strengths of Acids and  Bases,  which you  will  use extensively throughout Module 8. </p>
