<h3 class="unitDh3">Unit D Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Unit D you studied chemical  equilibrium. Module 7 introduced the principles of chemical equilibrium and Module 8 focused on the equilibrium of acids and bases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Your study in this unit required you to rethink the way you understood chemical systems. By studying chemical equilibrium you have begun to consider what reactions have occurred to get the chemical system to its current equilibrium and how this equilibrium could  be altered if conditions were to change.</p>
<p><br />
  Throughout Unit D you completed summaries intended to clarify concepts of chemical equilibrium. Your summaries also helped you see how knowledge of equilibrium adds to your understanding of solutions of acids and bases as aqueous chemical systems. Check to make sure you updated your summaries and saved them in your course folder. </p>
<p><br />
  If you continue to study chemistry at the post-secondary level, you will be introduced to many areas of chemistry in which considering equilibrium is a regular part of chemical analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You investigated the following module questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 7</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is happening in a system at equilibrium?</li>
  <li>How do scientists predict shifts in the equilibrium of a system?<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Module 8<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do  Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acids and bases illustrate equilibrium?</li>
</ul>
<p> Because equilibrium  allows you to consider the microscopic and macroscopic changes that may occur, you now know that equilibrium is an important tool for studying any chemical system. The chemical industry applies knowledge of chemical equilibrium to manipulate conditions that allow processes to occur. Finally, having qualitatively and quantitatively considered equilibrium, you better understand how strong acids and bases behave differently from weak acids and bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to </p>
<ul>
  <li>explain that there is a balance of opposing reactions in chemical equilibrium systems </li>
  <li>determine quantitative relationships in simple equilibrium systems </li>
</ul>

<p><br />
  Complete the <a href="c30_ud_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit D Diagnostic Self-Check</a> to review the concepts, skills, and knowledge introduced and to assess your understanding of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have trouble answering any of the questions, try one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the lesson(s) indicated for each question. Once there, review the information provided and the relevant sections of the textbook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>View the hint associated with each question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at the answer and then work backward to understand the problem and its solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask your teacher for help.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>You understand how important it is to review material in preparation for any tests your teacher may give you and in solidifying your understanding of new concepts. Completing these questions is just one part of your review. Program of Studies information is associated with each question. You may wish to use this information to identify areas in which you need to pay particular attention. You may also answer the questions that appear at the end of each chapter and unit in the textbook.</p>
  <p><br />
  You have already reviewed your Modules 7 and 8 concept maps or graphic organizers. Now is a good time to give them another look and add any new connections or ideas to them.</p>
