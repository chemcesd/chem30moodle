<h3>Chemistry 30 Conclusion </h3>
<h4>Course Conclusion</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations,  you have completed Chemistry 30 Learn EveryWare!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
In preparation  for your Chemistry 30 Diploma Examination you may wish to revisit the Diagnostic Self-Check activities that appear at the end of each unit:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ua/c30_ua_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit A Diagnostic Self-Check</a></li>
  <li><a href="ub/c30_ub_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit B Diagnostic Self-Check</a></li>
  <li>    <a href="uc/c30_uc_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit C Diagnostic Self-Check</a></li>
  <li>    <a href="ud/c30_ud_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit D Diagnostic Self-Check</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you work  through these Self-Check questions  you may wish to spend a little more time on the extra information provided. 
  For example, read the Program of Studies objectives, and then think about the other questions you have seen in this  course that assess your knowledge of the same  Program of Studies objectives. What kinds of questions might appear on the Diploma Examination to test your understanding of each objective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another  strategy to prepare for your diploma examination may be to prepare a &ldquo;can-do&rdquo;  list for each of the objectives in the Chemistry 30 Program of Studies. Simply go through the list of objectives and  determine whether you &ldquo;can do&rdquo; each of the knowledge and skills objectives  listed. For each of the objectives, you may wish to include an example of a  question, exercise, or lab in which you demonstrated your understanding of the objective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact your  teacher to see whether  there will be a final test or assessment  for you to complete prior to your Diploma Examination. Good luck!</p>
