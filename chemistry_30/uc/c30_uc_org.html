<h5>Module Descriptions</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Module 5&mdash;Hydrocarbons and the Petroleum Industry</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  petroleum industry is considered a keystone industry in Alberta. It produces more than 70 000  products used by society on a daily basis, creates thousands of jobs, and, as  you learned in Module 4, generates significant tax revenues for the province of Alberta. Without the petroleum industry  in Alberta,  Albertans&rsquo; quality of life would drop significantly. In Module 5 you will learn  about hydrocarbons, the basis of the petroleum industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will consider the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is petroleum?</li>
  <li>What does Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry do?</li>
  <li>Where do hydrocarbons come from?</li>
  <li>What are hydrocarbons and what makes them such an important class of compounds?</li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry?</li>
  <li>What impact does the hydrocarbon industry have on Alberta&rsquo;s economy and environment?</li>
</ul>
<h6>Module 6&mdash;Petrochemicals</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  petrochemical industry is an important subset of the petroleum industry. In  Module 6 you will learn how and what petrochemicals are produced and used in Alberta. You will also begin to  assess the sustainability of this chemical industry. You will investigate the importance of the  petrochemical industry and the impact the industry has on your community, Alberta, Canada,  and the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will consider the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kinds of chemical reactions are used to  manipulate hydrocarbons in order to produce petrochemicals?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How has the chemical industry responded to  concerns about the environment?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within  Alberta&rsquo;s petrochemical industry?</li>
  </ul>
<h5>Using the Concept Organizer</h5>
<p><br />
  Each module and lesson contains focusing questions intended to guide your   study. The following concept organizers list the module and lesson   questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../images/pdf_files/m5/001a_m5_con_map.pdf" target="_blank">Module 5 Concept Organizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="../images/pdf_files/m6/001a_concept map.pdf" target="_blank">Module 6 Concept Organizer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you work your way through each module, think about how the lesson   questions relate to the module questions and to questions from other lessons.   Use the concept organizers to build a concept map or a graphic organizer for   each module. To do this, you might use software you already have on your   computer, or you might do an Internet search for free software you can use. In   your concept map or graphic organizer, record and demonstrate how the lesson and   module concepts are connected and interdependent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sample concept maps are provided in the Module Summary for each module.   Remember that the samples are just that&mdash;they show only one of many possible   descriptions. However, if your completed concept map or graphic organizer   differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your teacher or   to compare your map or organizer to those of your classmates. This will ensure   that your interpretations of lesson materials and your descriptions are   accurate.</p>
