<h3 class="unitCh3">Unit C Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">

<p>Can you  find one similarity among all of the products in this picture? If you identified  petroleum, you were correct. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Petroleum&rsquo;s carbon chains (cyclic molecular structures of  hydrocarbons) can be manipulated in many ways to make new molecules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  manipulation of molecules from petroleum happens in many locations in Alberta. This manipulation of hydrocarbon molecules, known as organic chemistry, is at the  heart of the petroleum industry and is the focus of <span class="nowrap">Unit C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The petroleum industry is considered a keystone industry in Alberta. It produces  more than 70 000 products used by society on a daily basis, creates thousands  of jobs, and, as you learned in Module 4, generates significant tax revenues  for the province   of Alberta. Without the petroleum  industry in Alberta,  Albertans&rsquo; quality of life would drop significantly. In <span class="nowrap">Module 5</span> you will learn  about hydrocarbons, the basis of the petroleum industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The petrochemical industry is an important subset of the petroleum industry.  In Module 6 you will learn how and what petrochemicals are produced and used in  Alberta, and  you will begin to assess the sustainability of this chemical industry. You will investigate the importance  of the petrochemical industry and the impact the industry has on Alberta,  Canada,  and the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of Unit C you will be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>identify and explain how organic compounds are a common form of matter</li>
  <li>describe chemical reactions of organic compounds</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Unit  C Assessment you will consider a chemical process used in the development of a common pharmaceutical compound, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). You will consider this chemical process from different perspectives, which will require you to apply your knowledge of organic chemistry and chemical reactions.</p>
