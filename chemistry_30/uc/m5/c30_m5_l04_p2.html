<div class="right1blockC"><strong>aromatics:</strong>  a class of hydrocarbons in which all hydrocarbons  contain benzene or a <span class="nowrap">benzene-like</span> ring </div>
<p><strong>Aromatics</strong> include benzene and all compounds that contain a  benzene-like structure. The chemical formula for benzene is C<span class="subscript">6</span>H<span class="subscript">6</span>  but the structural diagram is more difficult to pinpoint. The structure of  benzene is unique to this class of hydrocarbons. This is a unique class of compounds because of its combination of  physical and chemical properties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read  pages 381&ndash;382 in  the textbook to learn more about the evidence that led to the development of a  chemical structure for benzene.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Consider this early model for the structure of  benzene.<br />

  <dd><img src="../../images/m5/058_compound.jpg" alt="An illustration shows the chemical structure of benzene. The chemical structure is a six-membered ring of carbon atoms. Each carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom. The ring has three double bonds, between the first and second, third and fourth, and fifth and sixth carbon atoms. " width="160" height="219" /><br />
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>Identify one piece of evidence listed on page 381 that supports using this chemical  structure as a representation for benzene and one piece of evidence that suggests  this is not an appropriate representation for this molecule. Share your  evidence with your teacher.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Consider the following two  illustrations:<br />
    <br />
  </dt>
  <dd><img src="../../images/m5/059_compound.jpg" width="305" height="170" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>In both diagrams, the inner circle illustrates that there are not three specific double  bond locations; rather, there is a way for all six carbons in the ring to bond  to the remaining electrons.</p>

<p>Use these strategies when naming aromatics:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>If       there is an alkyl branch attached to a benzene, it is called an       alkylbenzene.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>If       you have more than one alkyl branch attached to a benzene, always number the benzene       ring so that the numbers are the lowest possible (you will always have a branch       numbered one). <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>If there       is a benzene ring attached to a larger molecule, the benzene is considered       the branch and is called a phenyl branch.</li>
