<p>Examine the map shown in &ldquo;Figure 2&rdquo; on page 359 of the textbook. Locate approximately  where you live and the type(s) of fossil fuels found in your area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a camera to take a picture of something that demonstrates activity around  the natural petroleum resource in your area. If you do not have a camera,  sketch a drawing or otherwise obtain an image of the activity. Obtain enough information  to write a caption describing your photograph. Your caption should include a brief  description of the object photographed, the object&rsquo;s location, and any other relevant  information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your photograph and caption in your course folder.</p>

<p><img src="../icons/discuss.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Post your photograph and caption  to the discussion area for your class. Look at other students&rsquo; postings.  Do you see any forms of activity that surprise you? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your course folder, save a list of anything  that surprises you or   that you did not previously know about the petrochemical industry.</p>

<div class="right1blockC"><strong>hydrocarbon:</strong> a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms</div>
<p>Petroleum is a mixture of <strong>hydrocarbons</strong>. There are six main raw  sources of hydrocarbons: natural gas, coalbed methane, crude oil, heavy oil, oil  sands, and coal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 356&ndash;359 in the textbook to learn  more about the natural sources of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your reading you have learned that the  petroleum industry involves locating, extracting, and refining natural  resources. The petrochemical industry is also part of the petroleum industry. In the petrochemical industry, chemicals  created from fossil fuels are used to make products such as antifreeze windshield  fluid  and plastics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In TR 1 you took a  photograph as evidence of a petroleum industry activity in your area.&nbsp;Can you identify what aspect of the petroleum  industry your photograph represents? If so, add this information to the caption you saved  in your course folder.</p>

    <p><strong>Case Study 1.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Oil sands,  natural gas, and conventional crude oil are the most widespread fossil fuel  deposits in Alberta.<br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>Coal and coalbed methane are found in Alberta but are not depicted  in &ldquo;Figure 2.&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Case Study 2.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Classically, research was done first and  development followed later.</li>
      <li>Universities did the research and industry  did the development.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Case Study 3.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Processing fossil fuels requires refineries for oil, upgraders for bitumen  and heavy oil, processing plants for natural gas, and sorting and crushing facilities  for coal. Transportation is mainly by pipelines for oil and natural gas, tanker  truck for liquid fuels such as gasoline, and truck (shorter distances) and  railcar (longer distances) for coal.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Case Study 4.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      The following  are examples of trade-offs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Positive       outcome: Jobs are created by the tar sands industry.<br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>Negative       consequence: When strip mining is used, it degrades the environment.<br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>Positive       outcome: Citizens enjoy the independence and convenience of driving       <span class="nowrap">gasoline-powered</span> vehicles.</li>

    <p>Natural gas, coal, crude oil, heavy oil, oil sands, and coalbed methane  are found in Alberta.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Section 9.1 3.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      The two major kinds of refining are oil refining and natural gas refining.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Oil refining starts with crude oil or synthetic crude from bitumen. The  crude undergoes fractional distillation followed by processing, such as hydrotreating or reforming of some of the fractions. Many products result.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In natural gas refining, the natural gas is condensed, distilled, and  processed to remove impurities. The main product is methane gas. Only a few  other products result, chiefly ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.</p>

    <p>You may have  listed other perspectives on some of the  statements.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Section 9.1 7.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      The two major energy sources are natural gas, which is a fossil fuel,  and electricity. Natural gas is used to fuel the furnace and hot water tank  and, in some homes, the stove and clothes dryer too. Electricity, which powers  lights and appliances, is produced mainly in power plants that burn coal or  natural gas.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your response may be a little different depending on how you interpreted the question&rsquo;s use of the term  <em>energy sources</em>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Section 9.1 8.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal power, and biomass  energy are renewable energy sources naturally available in Alberta. The question asked that you list  three of these sources.</p>
