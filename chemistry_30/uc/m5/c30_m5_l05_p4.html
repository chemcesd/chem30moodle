<p>Oil sand is a mixture of hydrocarbons with a different chemical composition than crude oil. Because of oil sand&rsquo;s special composition, it must be refined differently than other sources of hydrocarbons, such as crude oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read page 396 of the textbook to learn more  about how oil sand is refined and about how the hydrocarbons in bitumen undergo so many changes in the refining process that the end result is termed &ldquo;synthetic crude oil.&rdquo; </p>

  Bitumen  extracted from oil sand is a mixture containing a large proportion of aromatic  hydrocarbons, whereas crude oils contain a larger proportion of aliphatic  hydrocarbons. Both bitumen and crude oil are used to produce naphtha, a mixture  of hydrocarbons composed of between five to 12 carbons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> Draw chemical structures and  provide names for three molecules that could be found in the naphtha fractions  from the refining of bitumen and crude oil.</p>

        <strong>Sample Solution</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    Responses  may include any aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons of between five to  12 carbons each. Alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, and aromatic  compounds are all possible answers.
    To check the accuracy of the chemical structures you have drawn, you may wish to check the chemical structures shown in the textbook.
