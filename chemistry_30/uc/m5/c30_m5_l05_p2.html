  Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. There are different types  of crude oil. Read <span class="nowrap">pages 386&ndash;387</span> in the textbook to learn more about the  different types of crude oil, the property that determines the grade of crude oil, and the  refining process.</p>

  Refining and other processes, like dewaxing, make use of the different  boiling points of molecules within oil. </p>

        <strong>Practice 1.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Both a  fractionation tower and a laboratory-scale distillation apparatus 
      use a heat source to boil off components of a mixture. Both
      employ a vertical column to more efficiently separate and collect the fractions obtained by condensing them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In a  fractionation tower, the mixture is continuously fed in, and the fractions condense  simultaneously at various levels in the tower. In the lab-scale process, a  mixture is placed in the flask and the components are distilled and condensed  one at a time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 2.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Crude oil is heated in the absence  of air in the fractionation tower because, at such a high temperature, the  oxygen in the air would cause the crude oil to burn.<br />

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Octane has a higher boiling point  than pentane because octane's London  forces are stronger, mainly due to octane's greater number of electrons (66 e-  versus 42 e-).<br />
            <br />
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pentane rises higher in the tower  than octane.</p>

    </ol>
    <p><strong>Practice 3.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      The  fractions used for cracking stock are kerosene, fuel oil, gas oil, and greases.  Cracking changes products that are in less demand into products that are in greater  demand. Cracking also results in products that give a greater monetary return to the  refinery.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 4.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      Approximately  95% of petroleum is used as fuel. The major fuel produced is gasoline.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 5.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Straight-run gasoline contains  hydrocarbons with five to 12 carbon atoms, which is more than the lighter  fractions but less than the heavier fractions.<br />

        It is  assumed the fuel is vapourized before burning in the cylinder.</p>
      </li>
      </ol>
    <p><strong>Practice 6.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>The hydrocarbons are all similar  nonpolar molecules, so they are mutually soluble.<br />
            <br />
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Water  molecules are very unlike hydrocarbons in that water is a highly polar  hydrogen-bonded substance. There is little tendency for the crude oil solution  to dissolve any water.</p>

<p>Earlier  in this module you learned that cracking is the process by which larger  hydrocarbons are broken into smaller hydrocarbons. Cracking is one of the main  processes used to modify molecules in crude oil into more desirable forms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As  you learned in the previous section, 95% of crude oil is used to produce fuels  for heating or transportation. These fuels are a mixture of many hydrocarbons  ranging in size from five to 12 carbons  each. Read pages 389&ndash;391 in the textbook to  learn more about the chemical processes and different types of cracking involved  in refining oil. </p>

            <p><br />
              If only  physical means were used to refine oil, there would be too much of the heavier  fractions produced, and the supply of products such as gas oil and greases would  exceed the demand. Also, straight-run gasoline is of lower quality than  gasoline containing compounds produced by reforming and alkylation.</p>

            <p><strong>Practice 10.</strong></p>
            <p><br />
              Hydrocracking  is carried out on heavier fractions, whereas catalytic reforming is done on  lighter fractions. The processes complement each other because both improve the  quality of the gasoline produced at the refinery.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Practice 11.</strong></p>
            <p><br />
              Alkylation  increases the amount of branching within the molecules. Catalytic reforming  provides an increase in the amount of aromatic molecules in the gasoline.</p>
