<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crude oil refining is a billion-dollar industry. As  you have learned in this lesson, Alberta  is a major producer of crude oil and synthetic crude oil. However, only a small  percentage of this oil is refined in Alberta.  It is cheaper to transport crude through pipelines to other  major centres for refining than it is to refine the oil in Alberta. The refined oil can then be shipped shorter distances to users. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>View the <a href="../../mm/m5/raw.pdf" target="_blank">pipeline  map of North   America</a>. Can  you identify the markets for Alberta oil using  the map<a href="../../mm/m5/raw.pdf" target="_blank"></a>? </p>

<p><br />
  What are the responsibilities and consequences of being a crude oil producer  and exporter? Is it appropriate to export oil? These are hot topics among  Albertans and others. Many people believe that the synthetic crude oil sold by Alberta is &ldquo;dirty oil&rdquo;  because of the environmental damage caused by extracting and refining bitumen.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write a couple of paragraphs to share your opinion on whether Alberta should extract and refine crude oil.  Post your response in the discussion area for your class and read the opinions  of at least two other students. </p>
