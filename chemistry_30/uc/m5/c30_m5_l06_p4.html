<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 6 you considered the following   questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What opinions does society have with respect to the petroleum industry?</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>The petroleum industry relies on many complex processes. The processes are not all chemical&mdash;the industry is also shaped by political, economic, technological, ecological, and societal issues and processes. The petroleum industry&rsquo;s future will be determined by considering and balancing the needs of all from a variety of perspectives.</p>
