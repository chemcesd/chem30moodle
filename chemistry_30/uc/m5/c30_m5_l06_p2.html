<p>The petroleum industry supplies fuel for automobiles. As a result, the petroleum and automobile industries are linked. One of the most common combustion reactions that occurs  around you happens inside a car engine. From previous science courses you know there are  products of combustion reactions.  You may recall that some of these products can have global effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cars are often lined up at drive-thrus. Their engines are running, but they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Signs like the one shown in the photograph indicate there is concern about idling. Why the concern? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> You may remember that a combustion reaction is the rapid reaction of a chemical with oxygen to produce oxides and heat. Read pages 398&ndash;400 in the textbook to  learn more about combustion reactions and the concerns about tailpipe emissions  and other exhaust.</p>

<p><strong>SC  1. </strong>Write two balanced equations: one for the complete  and one for the incomplete combustion of pentane. Compare the oxygen needed in  each equation.</p>

    <p><strong>SC  1.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      complete  combustion: C<span class="subscript">5</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span>(l) + 8 O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) &rarr; 5 CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + 6 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>incomplete  combustion: 2  C<span class="subscript">5</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span>(l) + 11 O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) &rarr; 10 CO(g) + 12 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)<br />
      (one  of many possible equations)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the first equation 8 mol of O<span class="subscript">2</span> are required per mol of  pentane. In the second equation 5.5 mol of O<span class="subscript">2</span> are required per mol  of pentane. Complete combustion generally requires more oxygen than incomplete  combustion.</p>

<h6>Other Problems with  Combustion Reactions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your reading you know that the quantity of  oxygen available to a hydrocarbon is important in ensuring complete combustion.  But is ensuring complete combustion the answer to environmental concerns? In Chemistry 20 you learned about carbon dioxide, its action as a  greenhouse gas, and how this has contributed to global climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quantity of uncombusted hydrocarbons present in  automobile exhaust is another reason vehicle idling is a problem. These  compounds can range from components initially in the fuel that do not react  with oxygen at all, to new hydrocarbons produced as side products. Some of  these hydrocarbons are the same compounds that are present in tobacco and other sources of smoke.  You may know from health warnings that some of these compounds can be carcinogenic.</p>

    <strong>SC  2.</strong> Use the Internet to compile two lists of  hydrocarbons: one for those present in car exhaust, and one for those present  in diesel exhaust. Comment on the composition of each list. Can you identify  any similarities between the substances appearing  in each list?</p>

    <p><strong>SC  2.</strong> Many hydrocarbons are present in exhaust from both  fuel types, but the percentage of each compound can be quite low. Depending upon  the composition of the fuel in the research collected, benzene and toluene are present  at relatively high levels. You may have identified the following trends: </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Diesel produces a greater percentage of black carbon (soot) and       polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) than gasoline.</li>
      </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Gasoline tends to produce a higher quantity of  smaller hydrocarbons, which is not surprising considering gasoline is composed of hydrocarbons  from a fraction of refined oil that has fewer carbons that diesel fuel.</li>
    </ul>

  Combustion processes using fossil fuels have other  unwanted side products. Nitrogen monoxide, <span class="nowrap">NO(g),</span> is a by-product of combustion  reactions that occur at high temperatures, such as the temperature in an  engine or furnace. Nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are produced when NO  reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere. These two compounds contribute to the production of acid  deposition.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A gasoline component that contributes to the  formation of acids is sulfur, often present within organic compounds in fuel. As  you saw earlier, sulfur can be removed from natural gas. Efforts are underway  to improve sulfur removal from other petroleum sources, including crude oil and  natural gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read page 393 in the textbook to learn more about  the process used to remove sulfur from gasoline.</p>

    <p><strong>SC 3.</strong> Elemental sulfur is a product of the treatment process. Because of the large  volume of gasoline produced, a large quantity of elemental sulfur is also  produced. The sulfur is often stored outdoors in large blocks, which become  extremely large over time. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As shown in the picture, because of their exposure  to wind, rain, and snow, blocks can erode over time. The picture also shows a plastic-lined  trench designed to collect water that drains from the block. The plastic lining  prevents the water from seeping into the underlying soil. If it is not  contained, water in this trench could become acidified and could pose a threat to  biological systems.</p>
