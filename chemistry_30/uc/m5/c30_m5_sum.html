<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Hydrocarbons and the Petroleum Industry</h3>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" alt="Summary" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you considered  the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is petroleum?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What does Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry do?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Where do hydrocarbons come from?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What are hydrocarbons and what makes them such an important class of compounds?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What impact does the hydrocarbon industry have on Alberta&rsquo;s economy and environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>You explored the structure  and properties of hydrocarbon molecules, and you learned that natural gas, crude  oil, and oil sands are being developed to provide the hydrocarbons used by  society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydrocarbons are a unique  class of molecules that can exist in many forms.   In this module you saw that a similar number of carbon and hydrogen atoms can have different arrangements. These arrangements are called isomers. Hydrocarbon molecules, including their isomers, are named according to the systematic naming  process, which communicates the important aspects of a molecule&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure and arrangement  of carbon atoms provide hydrocarbons with unique chemical and physical  properties. The natural gas, crude oil, and oil sands refining processes rely  on these unique properties and many different reaction types. The  physical property of boiling point, for example, is used to refine hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 5, you may have added information to a concept   map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson questions listed in the   Module 5 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time to review the relationships in   your concept map or graphic organizer and to try to answer the module and lesson   questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="c30_m5_sum_01.html" target="_blank">sample Module 5 concept map</a> shows one set of possible links between the   questions. Remember that this is one possible description only&mdash;there are many   other correct possibilities. However, if your completed concept map or graphic   organizer differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your   teacher or to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your   class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials and your   descriptions are accurate.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="35" height="32" /> Module Assessment</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you investigated  the class of molecules called hydrocarbons.  In your Module Assessment you  will summarize your understanding of the importance of hydrocarbons by preparing a list of five hydrocarbons and their uses.  In your list, identify  and describe the importance of the five hydrocarbons  from a variety of perspectives.  You may wish to consult page 45 of the textbook for more information on perspectives.</p>

<p> Use the scoring guide provided to plan your response and to revise your work before submitting it to your teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your completed Assessment in your course folder, and submit a copy to your teacher.</p>
