<p>How careful  are you about storing fruits and vegetables? Did you know that the ripening of fruits and vegetables can be influenced by other produce or even by the container in which the produce is stored? It might surprise you to know that a simple but important hydrocarbon molecule influences the ripening process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables release ethylene, which acts as a hormone in fruits and vegetables and influences their ripening and aging. Ethylene is also called ethene and has the chemical  formula C<span class="subscript">2</span>H<span class="subscript">4</span>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may notice that the name and chemical formula of ethene is different from the alkanes you studied in the previous lesson. In Lesson 1 you learned that the rules used to name  hydrocarbons allowed for communicating the structure of the molecule.  How might ethene be different from ethane? What aspects of these two molecules might be similar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson  3 you will focus on other classes of hydrocarbons&mdash;alkenes, alkynes,  cycloalkanes, and cycloalkenes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 3: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkenes, and cycloalkynes?</li>
  <li>How is the structure of an unsaturated hydrocarbon communicated?</li>
  <li>What is the abundance and significance of unsaturated hydrocarbons?</li>
  <li>How does industry use alkenes and alkynes?</li>
  </ul>

<p><br />
  The Lesson  3 assignment will assess your ability to name and write structural formulas for  the types of hydrocarbons you studied in Lessons 2 and 3. Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m5_l03_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 5: Lesson 3 Assignment</a> to your computer now. You will receive further  instructions on how to complete this Assignment later in the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the  teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the  practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You  should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
