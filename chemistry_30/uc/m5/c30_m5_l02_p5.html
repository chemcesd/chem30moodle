<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Hydrocarbons and the Petroleum Industry</h3>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p><br />
  In Lesson 2 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are alkanes?</li>
  <li>What industries use alkanes?</li>
  <li>What steps are used to refine       natural gas?</li>
</ul>
<p>You identified that natural gas is a source of alkanes, and that alkanes  are a diverse group of hydrocarbon molecules that can have a variety of structural  forms. You learned to identify the key components of alkanes, to draw their  chemical structures, and to write the systematic names for an alkane and its  isomers. You also began to consider the petroleum industry from a variety  of perspectives, and you  collected evidence of the petroleum industry's impact on your local area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>alkanes:</strong> a class of hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>alkyl  branch:</strong> a group of  carbon and hydrogen atoms joined by single bonds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group is not part of the main structure of a hydrocarbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>cycloalkanes:</strong> a cyclic (carbon chain forms a
    circle) hydrocarbon in which all of the bonds between carbon
  atoms are single bonds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>structural isomers:</strong> compounds that share the same chemical formula but have different chemical structures</p>
