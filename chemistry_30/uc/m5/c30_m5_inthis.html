        <h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Hydrocarbons and the Petroleum Industry</h3>
        <h4>In This Module</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Fossil Fuels</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you  observed evidence of the hydrocarbon industry in your local area? In Lesson 1 you will begin to investigate the kinds of activities that are involved  in the extraction and processing of hydrocarbons from petroleum. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What are hydrocarbons?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is petroleum?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Alkanes</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once  petroleum is extracted, the refining process can begin. In Lesson 2 you will  learn about different kinds of hydrocarbon molecules. You will specifically learn about alkanes,  a type of hydrocarbon molecule that is present in, and must be separated from, natural gas. You will also  consider the use of coalbed methane as an energy source. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What are alkanes?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What industries use alkanes?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What steps are used to refine       natural gas?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Alkenes and Alkynes</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are  hundreds of thousands of different hydrocarbon molecules. How do you  communicate a particular type of  hydrocarbon molecule? In Lesson 3 you will learn  about the systematic naming process used to identify four more classes of  hydrocarbon molecules. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are alkenes, alkynes,       cycloalkenes, and cycloalkynes?</li>
          <li>How is the structure of an       unsaturated hydrocarbon communicated?</li>
          <li>What is the abundance and       significance of unsaturated hydrocarbons?</li>
          <li>How does industry use alkenes       and alkynes?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Aromatics</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Lesson 3 you learned that hydrocarbon molecules can exist in closed structures. One group of hydrocarbons has a unique closed structure, the aromatic ring.  In Lesson 4 you will learn about aromatic compounds and how their properties make them a distinct group of hydrocarbons.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are aromatic compounds?</li>
          <li>How do aromatic compounds       differ from other hydrocarbons?</li>
          <li>Why are there safety concerns       associated with some aromatic compounds?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Alberta&rsquo;s Oil Industry</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is more to Alberta&rsquo;s oil industry  than pumpjacks. Alberta has heavy oil reserves and vast reserves of oil sand. In <span class="nowrap">Lesson 5</span> you will investigate the different types of petroleum resources that are being developed in Alberta.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is crude oil?</li>
          <li>What is oil sand?</li>
          <li>How is crude oil refined?</li>
          <li>Why is oil sand processed?</li>
          <li>What products come from crude       and other oil types?</li>
          <li>How is the oil industry       affected by economics?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Lesson 6</strong>&mdash;<strong>Environmental Impact of  Fossil Fuels and Alberta&rsquo;s  Oil Industry</strong></h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In previous  science courses you were introduced to the concept of a greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect  identifies a central relationship between the combustion of hydrocarbons and the warming of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. In Lesson 6 you will review this evidence, and you will  consider other local,  provincial, national, and international impacts of Alberta&rsquo;s hydrocarbon and petroleum  industries. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will  investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What processes in the petroleum industry impact the environment?</li>
          <li>What effect does the reaction of hydrocarbons have on the environment?</li>
          <li>What opinions does society have with respect to the  petroleum industry?</li>
        </ul>
