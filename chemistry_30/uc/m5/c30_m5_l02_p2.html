  There are six main steps in the natural gas refining  process:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>Water and liquid hydrocarbons are removed from the gas.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hydrogen sulfide gas is removed through a reaction with an amine.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hydrogen sulfide gas reacts with oxygen to make sulphur dioxide.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining hydrogen sulfide and sulphur dioxide are further recovered       to make blocks of sulphur.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining parts are cooled under high pressure to condense all       components except methane.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The condensed liquid is distilled to further separate the components.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  &ldquo;Table 1&rdquo; on page 363 of the textbook lists six hydrocarbon  components of natural gas. The main components are methane, propane, ethane,  and pentane. What is similar about these molecules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 366&ndash;367 in the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC"><strong>alkanes:</strong>  a class of hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds</div>
<p>The components of natural gas all end in &ldquo;ane&rdquo; and  are considered <strong>alkanes</strong>. As hydrocarbons, alkanes are composed of only hydrogen and carbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methane, ethane, propane, and butane represent the  simpler alkane molecules. Regardless of the number of carbon atoms, an  alkane will always have single bonds between all carbon atoms. The remaining bonds that carbon atoms can make are to hydrogen atoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will recall from your work in Chemistry 20 that carbon atoms have four bonds to other atoms. For alkanes, each carbon will be chemically bonded to four other atoms, either carbon or hydrogen.</p>

<h6>Molecular Models  of C<span class="subscript">5</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span></h6>
<p><br />
  How many different forms can a molecule with the  formula C<span class="subscript">5</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span> have? Use materials you find at home or at  school to construct a molecular model of each of the different forms you  identify. Recall the following information  when constructing  your representations of hydrocarbons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Carbon atoms can bond with up to four other atoms.</li>
  <li>Hydrogen atoms can only bond with one other atom.</li>
  <li>In alkanes, only one bond exists between two adjacent carbon atoms.</li>
  <li>The general chemical formula for an alkane is C<span class="subscript"><em>n</em></span>H<span class="subscript">2<em>n</em> + 2</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>Use a digital camera to take a picture of each  of the models you constructed. If you do not have a digital camera, sketch  your drawings digitally (using a program on your computer) or by hand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Summarize your work in a table.&nbsp;The table should have a column for each of the  molecular models you constructed and a row for the pictures you took. Paste your pictures or sketches in your table. Later in this lesson, you will add rows to the table as you re&ndash;examine  the molecules you constructed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong>Explain the principle underlying information  points 1 and 2 above.</p>

  Methane, ethane, propane, and butane represent the simpler, linear alkane molecules. In <span class="nowrap">TR 1&ndash;3</span>  you probably noticed that the molecules you constructed had either linear appearances&mdash;all carbons connected to form a continuous chain, or branched appearances&mdash;one or more carbon atoms bonded to only a single carbon along the continuous chain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 367&ndash;368 in the textbook to learn more  about branched hydrocarbons. Complete &ldquo;Sample problem 9.1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Communication  example 1&rdquo; on pages 368&ndash;369 of the textbook. In Module 6 you will learn that hydrocarbons with  branches can be manufactured. </p>

    <strong>SC 2.</strong> Retrieve a copy of the table you started in  TR 2.

Save a copy of your table in your course  folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability of a carbon atom to have up to four bonds creates the possibility  of branching along the length of a hydrocarbon molecule. An <strong>alkyl branch </strong>is not part of the main chain and contains only  carbon and hydrogen. Even though they  have the same molecular formula,  each structure is considered  a different  entity. Not only do the isomers have different names, but often they have differences in their properties, which can allow them to have different uses.</p>
