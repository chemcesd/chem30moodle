<p>So far in Module 5 you have learned about hydrocarbon compounds present  in natural gas. Natural gas is only one of the natural sources of hydrocarbons  in Alberta. As  you can see in &ldquo;Figure 2&rdquo; on page 359 in the textbook, Alberta is also rich in  hydrocarbons from oil&mdash;heavy oil, conventional crude oil, and oil sand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier  in this module you were asked to look for evidence of activity in the petroleum  industry in your local area. Was the activity you photographed related to natural  gas, oil, or oil sand production?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will investigate  the different types of petroleum resources that are being developed in Alberta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 5:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>What is crude oil?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is oil sand?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is crude oil refined?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is oil sand processed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What products come from crude       and other oil types?</p>
  </li>
  <li>    How is the oil industry       affected by economics?</li>
  </ul>
