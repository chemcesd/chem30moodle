<h5> <img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p><br />
  In Lesson 4 you considered the  following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are aromatic compounds?</li>
  <li>How do aromatic compounds       differ from other hydrocarbons?</li>
  <li>Why are there safety concerns       associated with some aromatic compounds?</li>
</ul>
<p>Benzene and other aromatic compounds are naturally occurring compounds  that possess a similar chemical structure, the benzene ring. As you have  learned in this lesson, the benzene ring is a unique chemical structure that gives  this class of compounds unique chemical properties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant  health concerns associated with some aromatic compounds, some of which are  restricted or have to be used with appropriate caution. Some common substances, such  as Aspirin (a pain reliever) and vanillin (a flavouring agent), are aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>aromatics:</strong> a class of hydrocarbons in which all hydrocarbons  contain benzene or a benzene-like ring</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>bioremediation:</strong> a process that uses natural mechanisms, including bacteria and fungi, to remove toxic materials from soil or water</p>
