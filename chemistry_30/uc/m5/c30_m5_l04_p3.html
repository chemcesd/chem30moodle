<div class="right2blockC"><strong>bioremediation: </strong>a process that uses natural mechanisms, including bacteria and fungi, to remove toxic materials from soil or water</div>
<p>Soil contaminated with hydrocarbons can be treated using <strong>bioremediation</strong>. Bacteria  that commonly live in the soil use many hydrocarbons as a food source. These bacteria remove hydrocarbons from the soil by eating them.</p>

<p>Because of the chemical structure of the benzene ring, soil contaminated  with benzene compounds is much more difficult to bioremediate. The unique  bonding relationship in a benzene ring makes benzene a highly stable chemical  structure. Soil and other material contaminated with benzene and other harmful  aromatic compounds are often treated using special waste treatment processes.</p>

<p>Benzene is currently a restricted chemical substance. Benzene and other aromatic compounds are found in  crude oil and natural gas and can be separated during refining. Despite its  link to cancer, benzene is used in many chemical processes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepare a list of products  that are produced using benzene. Research what alternatives exist to the use of  benzene. </p>
