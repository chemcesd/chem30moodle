<p>In Module 5 you will investigate the structure and  properties of hydrocarbon molecules. You will learn about the sources of hydrocarbons, and how these natural resources are developed by society. You will learn about the industries that are  involved in the extraction, refining, modification, and manipulation of  hydrocarbon molecules. You will build on and apply what you learn in this  module to your study of petrochemicals in Module 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you will investigate the following  questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is petroleum?</li>
  <li>What does Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry do?</li>
  <li>Where do hydrocarbons come from?</li>
  <li>What are hydrocarbons and what makes them such an important class of compounds?</li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry?</li>
  <li>What impact does the hydrocarbon industry have on Alberta&rsquo;s economy and environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that each lesson will also be organized around questions intended to   guide your study. As you proceed through Module 5, you may record answers to   these questions and any interrelationships that exist between them in a concept   map or graphic organizer. More information is available in the <a href="../c30_uc_org.html" target="_blank">Unit C Concept Organizer</a>. In   the Module 5 Summary you will receive further information on how you can use   your concept map or graphic organizer to review the concepts you studied in this   module.</p>
