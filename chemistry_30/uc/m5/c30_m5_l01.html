<div class="right1blockC"><strong>petroleum:</strong> a  mixture of hydrocarbons that is obtained from oil or natural gas</div>
<p>Are there structures like the ones shown in this picture in your community? Evidence of Alberta&rsquo;s <strong>petroleum</strong> industry is part of the  landscape in many parts of the province. Pipelines, flares, and refineries are obvious  indications of the level of this industry&rsquo;s activity in Alberta. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have noticed vehicles that  have the names of oil and gas companies on them or the names of companies that  support the exploration and extraction of oil, natural gas, and oil sand. Those are more obvious examples of the activity of the petroleum industry.  Are there other examples of this industry's activity that are less obvious but that still have an impact on your community?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will begin to explore the petroleum industry. <br />
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are       hydrocarbons?</li>
  <li>What is       petroleum?</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
  In this lesson you will research and  create a short write-up for a job in or related to the petroleum  industry. Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m5_l01_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 5: Lesson 1 Assignment</a> to your computer now. You will receive  further instructions on how to complete this assignment later in the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other questions in this lesson are not marked by the teacher; however, you   should still answer these questions. The <span class="nowrap">Self-Check,</span> Try This, and other types   of questions are placed in this lesson to help you review important information   and build key concepts that may be applied in future lessons. You should record   the answers to all of the questions in the lesson and place those answers in your   course folder.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a discussion with your teacher, you must decide what to do with the   questions that are not part of your assignment. For example, you may decide to   submit the responses to Try This and other questions that are not marked to your   teacher for informal assessment and feedback. Your answers are very important to   your teacher. They provide your teacher with information about your learning, and   they help your teacher identify where adjustments to your instruction may be   necessary.</p>
