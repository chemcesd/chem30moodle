<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><br />
  In your reading you learned that the inventor of a process used to extract bitumen from oil sand, Karl Clark, used carefully constructed experimentation to develop his process. Experiments to improve the recovery of bitumen from oil sand are still being carried out.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To test the effect of variables used in the extraction  of bitumen from   oil sand. This  investigation considers the following four variables and effect hypotheses:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>temperature: The amount of bitumen extracted from oil sand  increases as the temperature increases.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>pH: 
    The amount of bitumen extracted from oil sand  increases as the pH increases.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>air: If air is bubbled into a bitumen mixture and the  air bubbles are captured within the bitumen, then more bitumen floats to the  top as froth.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>calcium ion concentration: 
    Increasing  the calcium ion concentration increases the quantity of bitumen froth but  decreases the quality (purity) of the froth.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>Identify the best conditions for the extraction of bitumen from oil sand. Explain how the results from the investigation you viewed support your conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Explain how the results of the experiments in the investigation you viewed could be useful for developing technology that improves bitumen extraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Can you identify any limitations to the conclusions you could draw from these experiments?  How could these limitations be addressed? <br />
