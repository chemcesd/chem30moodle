<p>The fruit  production industry has taken advantage of the ethene that is naturally  produced by plants to better prepare fruits and vegetables for shipment, storage,  and sale. By controlling the concentration of ethene around produce, the  ripening process can be delayed or stimulated as required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspection of produce prior to  shipment is very important, because damaged fruits and vegetables produce more  ethene. If damaged produce is not removed, it may be a case of one bad apple spoiling  the whole bunch!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To promote ripening at home,  some people place ethene-producing fruits, like bananas,  peaches, pears, and nectarines, in bags with produce that is more  sensitive to ethene, such as broccoli, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, and mangos.</p>

<p>In this lesson you learned that cracking reactions are used to dehydrogenate ethane extracted from natural gas. You also learned that ethene can also be produced  from larger hydrocarbons extracted from other petroleum sources. In Module 6 you  will learn more about reactions that use ethene, including the process used to  convert ethene into plastic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look around the room in which you are sitting. Do you see many products made from plastic? These products are evidence of  the importance of ethene and of this class of hydrocarbons.</p>
