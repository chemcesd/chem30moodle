  </div>
<p>At the beginning of this lesson  you saw a picture of a sulfur block, a by-product of the refining of sour  natural gas. Sulfur blocks, like the one pictured, can be well over the size of a  city block. Seeing a structure like that might make you think about the  environmental impact of extracting, refining, and even using hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you identify evidence of an adverse  environmental impact caused by the petroleum industry in your local area? Capture  any evidence you see using your camera or make a list of your observations. Save your evidence  in your course folder.</p>
