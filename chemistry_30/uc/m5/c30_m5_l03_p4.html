  <h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary
    </h5>
  </h5>
  <p><br />
  In Lesson 3 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are alkenes, alkynes,       cycloalkenes, and cycloalkynes?</li>
  <li>How is the structure of an       unsaturated hydrocarbon communicated?</li>
  <li>What is the abundance and significance       of unsaturated hydrocarbons?</li>
  <li>How does industry use alkenes       and alkynes?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>Alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkenes, and cycloalkynes are  classes of hydrocarbon molecules that possess double or triple bonds. Molecules  of these classes exhibit properties that make them highly useful in industrial  processes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you were introduced to the procedures used to name  and write the structures for these compounds. You also learned about some  chemical reaction types that are used in their production and use.  In Module 6 you will learn more about the reactivity and chemical processes involving these unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>

<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>cracking:</strong> a process in which larger hydrocarbon molecules are converted into smaller hydrocarbon molecules</p>
