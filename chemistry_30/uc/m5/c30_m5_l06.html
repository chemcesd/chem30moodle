<p>Earlier in this module you collected photographic evidence  of the petroleum industry&rsquo;s activity in your local area. You may also have taken  pictures of the industry's effect on your community. Even if you did not take these photographs,  you can probably list many examples of the industry's impact. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will expand your consideration of the petroleum industry's impact. You will use the evidence you collected, including your  photographs and lists, to consider the impact of  hydrocarbons from fossil fuels from a local, provincial, national, and  international level. You will also research current trends in, and concerns  regarding, the petroleum industry and some possible directions for its future. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 6:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>What processes in the petroleum industry impact the environment?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What effect does the reaction of hydrocarbons have on the       environment?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What opinions does society have with respect to the petroleum       industry?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  this lesson you will also consider what you have learned about the petroleum  industry, and you will identify questions about the future of this industry you feel need  to be considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that  are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the  practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You  should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder. </p>
