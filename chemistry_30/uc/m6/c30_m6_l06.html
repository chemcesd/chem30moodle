<p>You now know that polymers are important substances that have many uses. Addition polymers, which you studied in Lesson 5, are formed when monomers with double bonds join to make much larger molecules.  Have you studied other reaction types that can also connect smaller molecules to make larger molecules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you learned about esterification reactions, a type of  condensation reaction in which a water molecule is formed when  alcohol and  organic acid molecules are joined together.  Could this reaction type be used to make a polymer?    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will learn how condensation polymerization reactions can be used to produce both synthetic (such as plastics) and natural polymers including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. You will compare many natural and synthetic polymers and their respective  properties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 6:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How do natural and       synthetic polymers compare?</li>
  <li>What are other       reaction mechanisms by which polymers can be made?</li>
</ul>
<p>You  will also take another look at how the petrochemical industry, and its  offshoot industries like the plastics industry, are attempting to green  their practices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that  are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the  practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You  should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course  folder.</p>
