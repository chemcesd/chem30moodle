<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 6&mdash;Petrochemicals</h3>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" alt="Summary" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 6  you considered the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What kinds of chemical reactions are used to manipulate  hydrocarbons in order to produce petrochemicals?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How has the chemical industry responded to concerns about  the environment?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some of the processes that occur within Alberta&rsquo;s  petrochemical industry?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You explored  the petrochemical industry and the processes used to convert the hydrocarbons found in petroleum into petrochemicals. Many of the products you use every day are made  from petrochemicals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  chemical structures of hydrocarbons are extremely important to the type of  petrochemical that can be made from the hydrocarbons and the reaction type that will work  with them. For example, you studied polymers,  which can be made by either addition reactions (from unsaturated compounds) or  condensation reactions (from hydrocarbon derivatives).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also  learned that it is important to consider atom economy and toxicity of reaction  by-products when designing chemical syntheses&mdash;these are important  considerations if the chemical industry is to demonstrate sustainability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 6, you may have added information to a concept   map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson questions listed in the   Module 6 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time to review the relationships in   your concept map or graphic organizer and to try to answer the module and lesson   questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../../images/pdf_files/m6/001_concept map.pdf" target="_blank">sample Module 6 concept   map</a> shows one set of possible links between the questions. Remember that   this is one possible description only&mdash;there are many other correct   possibilities. However, if your completed concept map or graphic organizer   differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your teacher or   to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your class.   This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials and your   descriptions are accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="35" height="32" align="bottom" /> Module Assessment</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Module 6 Assessment is included in the Unit  C Assessment. Refer to the Unit C Assessment for details. </p>
