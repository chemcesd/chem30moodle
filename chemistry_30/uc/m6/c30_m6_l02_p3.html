<div class="right1blockC"><strong>addition reaction:</strong> a  type of organic reaction involving an unsaturated hydrocarbon and a small  molecule, usually hydrogen or a halogen, that increases the saturation of the  hydrocarbon</div>
<p>You might recall from previous science courses that chemical reactions can be classified. You will also recall that certain reaction types tend to happen with certain reactants. A multiple bond between carbon atoms, like those found in alkenes and alkynes, can participate in a type of reaction called an <strong>addition reaction</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 419&ndash;421 in the textbook to learn how  addition reactions can be used to produce organic halides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in this lesson you were  asked to consider how you could use a hydrocarbon molecule to create a  hydrocarbon derivative and to describe the changes that needed to occur to  transform the molecule into the derivative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockC">
  <p><strong>substitution  reaction:</strong> a type of organic reaction involving breaking a carbon-hydrogen bond  and replacing the hydrogen atom with another atom or group of atoms </p>
  <div>
    <div> </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>If you thought this change required substituting  a hydrogen atom for a chlorine atom, you were well on your way to understanding <strong>substitution  reactions</strong>, another reaction type used to make organic halides.</p>
