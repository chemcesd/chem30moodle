<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the process used to       make plastic?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What properties must molecules       have if they are to be used in making plastic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Polymerization  is the process of creating large molecules by linking many smaller molecules  together. One type of polymerization is addition polymerization. This process  involves linking many alkene molecules  to form polymers. Polymers are many  monomers linked together. Synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and polystyrene are used to create a  variety of plastic products.
