          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>addition reaction:</strong> a type of organic reaction involving  an unsaturated hydrocarbon and a small molecule, usually hydrogen or a halogen,  that increases the saturation of the hydrocarbon</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>alcohol:</strong> an organic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups as the functional  group</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>amide  functional group:</strong> a group of atoms composed by connecting a carboxyl group to  an amine group</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>atom economy:</strong> the percentage of material present in  reactants that ends up in the desired product for a chemical process</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>carboxylic acids:</strong> a family of organic compounds  characterized by the carboxyl group <span class="nowrap">(-COOH)</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</strong> a group of organic compounds   composed of carbon, hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>condensation  polymerization:</strong> a  reaction in which a water molecule is produced when two monomers are chemically joined</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>esterification reaction:</strong> a  chemical reaction in which a carboxylic acid and an alcohol combine to produce  an ester and water</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>esters:</strong> a family of organic compounds characterized  by the ester functional group <span class="nowrap">(-COO-)</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>functional group:</strong> a characteristic arrangement of  atoms or bonds within a molecule that determines the most important chemical  and physical properties of a class of compounds</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>hydrocarbon derivative: </strong>a molecular compound of carbon, at least one other element, and, usually, hydrogen</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>monomer:</strong> a  small molecule that links with many other similar molecules in an addition or  condensation reaction to create a polymer</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>nylon:</strong> a synthetic condensation polymer</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>organic halide:</strong> an organic compound in which one or  more of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by halogen atoms</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>petrochemical:</strong> a chemical made or extracted from  petroleum</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>polymer:</strong> a  large molecule made by linking together many smaller molecules called monomers</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>polymerization:</strong> the process of forming polymers from monomers through addition or condensation  reactions</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>proteins:</strong> natural polymers of amino acids forming the basic material of living things</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>substitution reaction:</strong> a type of organic reaction involving  breaking a carbon-hydrogen bond and replacing the hydrogen atom with another  atom or group of atoms</p>
