        <h4>In This Module</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Petrochemicals  in Alberta</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Module 5 you learned about Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum reserves, but did you realize that more can be done with the petroleum?  Alberta is Canada's leading petrochemical manufacturer. The petrochemical industry is Alberta&rsquo;s second largest industry, and it is  worth $14 billion! In Lesson 1 you will begin to explore the petrochemical industry. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What are petrochemicals?</li>
          <li>What kinds of       products result from Alberta&rsquo;s       petrochemical industry? </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Organic Halides</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Among the most-used classes of petrochemicals are the organic halides. Organic halides are used in many applications, including  refrigerants and in the production of plastics. In  Lesson 2 you will learn how these halogen-containing molecules are made and used. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What are organic halides?</li>
          <li>In what reactions are organic       halides involved?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Alcohols</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You may have purchased blended gasoline recently.  Gasoline can be mixed with ethanol  to make blended gasoline. Ethanol is one member of a group of molecules called alcohols.   Alcohols have many uses in manufacturing. As a result of their properties, alcohols are one of the most-produced petrochemicals.    In Lesson 3 you will learn about the production and properties of alcohols like ethanol.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What are alcohols? </li>
          <li>Are alcohols being produced and       used in a responsible way?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Carboxylic  Acids and Esters</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Lesson 3 you learned about alcohols, a group of organic compounds that have a functional group containing oxygen.  In Lesson 4 you will  learn about two more classes of organic compounds&mdash;carboxylic acids and esters&mdash;and how the oxygen in their functional groups is critical to their chemical and physical properties. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What are carboxylic acids and       esters? </li>
          <li>How are carboxylic acids and       esters involved in the petrochemical industry?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Addition  Polymers</h5>
        <p><br />
        Vinyl and polyethene are names you probably recognize as types of plastics.  You may already know that there are many different types of plastics, each with different properties and uses. Vinyl and polyethene can only be made from certain types of petrochemcials using a specific type of reaction.  In Lesson 5 you will learn about the kinds of plastics that are created using an addition reaction.   </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the process used to make plastic?</li>
          <li>What properties must molecules have if they are to be used in making plastic?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 6&mdash;Condensation Polymers</h5>
        <p><br />
          Natural  polymers include proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and starches. In Lesson 6 you  will learn how these molecules are created by polymerization  reactions. You will also learn how synthetic polymers can be made using the same  functional groups. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You  will investigate the following lesson questions: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>How do natural and synthetic       polymers compare?</li>
          <li>What are other reaction       mechanisms by which polymers can be made?</li>
        </ul>
