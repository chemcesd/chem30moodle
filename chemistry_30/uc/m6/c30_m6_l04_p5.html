<p><br />
  Designing chemical reactions that consider atom  economy can be very helpful when attempting to improve efficiency and minimize  the chemical industry&rsquo;s effect on the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When greater proportions of a chemical reaction&rsquo;s  reactants end up in the product, fewer waste or by-products are made. In the  calculations you just performed, the only by-product is a water molecule, which  is both small and non-toxic. In general, complex syntheses involving multiple  reactions have lower atom economies and lower overall yields.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Develop an answer to one of the following questions.  When possible, use examples and relevant calculations to support your answers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>How does the molecular mass of the waste product of an esterification compare to the molecular mass of other organic reactions; for example, a substitution reaction?<br />
    <br />
    <strong>TR 2. </strong>Does the difference in the molecular mass of the by-products of the two reactions in TR 1 result in a significant  difference in the atom economy when these two types of reactions are compared?<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong>How could a chemical process be designed to maximize atom economy?<br />
    <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>TR 4. </strong>How would the atom economy of a process that requires many reactions compare to a process that is completed in one reaction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../icons/discuss.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Post your answer to the discussion area for your class. Read the responses of at least two other students. Do their responses show a correct understanding of atom economy? Share your constructive comments with your classmates. Revise your response, if necessary, and submit a copy to your teacher.</p>
