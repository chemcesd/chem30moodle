<p>Earlier in this module you considered concerns regarding the use of plastic shopping bags. Plastics  have received a negative reputation for polluting the environment and for taking  considerable time to degrade. These concerns are driving an increased interest in bioplastics.  Bioplastics are a type of biopolymer&mdash;a natural polymer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bioplastics  are made from polyalkanoates, a type of polymer containing ester bonds between  monomers. Polyalkanoates are created by some plants and bacteria. Since these polyesters are naturally produced,  they can also be broken down by bacteria and other organisms, making them  biodegradable. Could bioplastics be the material of the future?</p>
