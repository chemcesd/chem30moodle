<p>In the previous module you recorded signs of activity associated with the petroleum industry.  You may have identified local businesses or  activities in your community that use petroleum to make other products.  If Alberta has a source of petroleum, it makes sense that the province should  also have a lot of industry that uses petroleum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alberta's petrochemical industry  is a very large sector of the provincial economy.  It is estimated that over 7000 jobs are directly related to the petrochemical industry. You know that chemical engineers and technologists are required to operate petrochemical plants like the one pictured. However, when you consider the construction and maintenance of facilities and the support required to keep a workforce busy, you realize how many more people are indirectly employed by the petrochemical industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have recently learned that petroleum involves many different kinds of molecules, but  what happens in the petrochemical industry to the molecules in petroleum? In this lesson
  you will begin to investigate the petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are       petrochemicals?</li>
  <li>What       kinds of products result from Alberta&rsquo;s       petrochemical industry?</li>
  </ul>
  <h6><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="35" height="32" /> Module 6: Lesson 1 Assignment</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download a copy  of the  <a href="c30_m6_l01_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 6: Lesson 1 Assignment</a> to your computer now.  You will receive further instructions on how to complete this assignment later  in the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in this  lesson you will also begin to record evidence and arguments from a variety of perspectives  on the use of hydrocarbons as petrochemicals or as fuel. This list will be  important in completing the final assessment in this module, which takes place at the end of Lesson 6. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other questions in this lesson are not marked by the teacher; however,   you should still answer these questions. The <span class="nowrap">Self-Check,</span> Try This, and other   types of questions are placed in this lesson to help you review important   information and build key concepts that may be applied in future lessons. You   should record the answers to all the questions in the lesson and place those   answers in your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a discussion with your teacher, you must decide what to do with the   questions that are not part of your assignment. For example, you may decide to   submit the responses to Try This and other questions that are not marked to your   teacher for informal assessment and feedback. Your answers are very important to   your teacher. They provide your teacher with information about your learning,   and they help your teacher identify where adjustments to your instruction may be   necessary.</p>
