<p><br />
  In Module 5 you learned about hydrocarbons. The  properties of hydrocarbon molecules make the molecules useful for a variety of  processes. What do you know about these processes? Complete TR 1 to find out.</p>

  <strong>TR 1. </strong>Complete  &ldquo;Starting Points&rdquo; questions 1&ndash;3 on page 410 in the textbook. Save a copy of your  answers in your course folder. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know the answers right  now&mdash;just answer each question to the best of your ability. Later in this module  you will have an opportunity to revise your answers before sharing them.</p>

  As  you get started in this module, it is important that you recall information  from Module 5. You will build on that information in Module 6. Refresh your  memory by completing SC 1.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 1. </strong>Complete &ldquo;Practice&rdquo; questions 1&ndash;3 on page 412 of the textbook.</p>

<p><strong>TR 2. </strong>Read through &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; on page 411 in the textbook. As you work through Module 6 you will learn more about the use of molecules from petroleum. Create a document in your course folder. In this document you will record evidence and arguments from a variety of perspectives that address the resolution stated in &ldquo;Exploration.&rdquo; Save your document in your course folder. Later you will summarize how this issue is viewed from various perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retrieve your copy of the Module 6: Lesson 1 Assignment that you saved to your computer earlier in this lesson. Print a copy of the structural formulae that appear at the end of the document. The  structural formulas are of the molecules listed in &ldquo;Figure 2&rdquo; on page 413 of  the textbook.     You may wish to use these structural formulas to answer SC 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2. </strong>Begin your investigation of chemical reactions involved in converting petroleum into petrochemicals by answering   &ldquo;Practice&rdquo; questions 5 and 7 on page 414 in the textbook.</p>

  <p><strong>petrochemical:</strong>  a chemical made or extracted from petroleum</p>
</div>
<p>In Alberta,  the two main sources for hydrocarbons are natural gas and crude oil. Currently  95% of the natural gas and crude oil harvested is burned as an energy source. The remaining 5% is  used as feedstock to create <strong>petrochemicals</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Petrochemicals include any chemicals  produced from petroleum. Examples of petrochemical products include plastics, synthetic clothing, shingles, cosmetics, paint, carpets, fertilizers, adhesives,  and even pharmaceuticals. The petrochemical industry is considered a secondary  or tertiary industry because it takes raw materials and creates products or  intermediaries from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Primary petrochemicals are raw chemicals that are  recovered from the earth. For example, you will recall from Module 5 that ethane  is a component of natural gas. It is used as feedstock to create ethene through  ethane cracking. Ethene has some uses, such as ripening fruit, but most ethene  is further processed to create other petrochemicals.</p>
