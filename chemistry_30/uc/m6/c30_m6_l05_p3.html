<p>Plastics  for food storage&mdash;often made of polypropylene and polystyrene&mdash;are tested for  safety. Tests have shown that polypropylene can be heated to high temperatures  without any leeching of monomers into the food or beverage the container holds.  Heating or exposing polystyrene to alcohol or oil, however, will cause a  breakdown of the polymer, which then leeches some styrene monomers into the food  or beverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plastics industry, a subset of the  petrochemical industry, is addressing safety and environmental concerns in several ways. For example, the recycle codes on plastic products provide  recycling information and tell consumers  how to safely use each product. The industry is also  adding a  variety of molecules to increase plastic&rsquo;s ability to biodegrade. In Lesson  6 you will learn about bioplastics, which can totally degrade.</p>
