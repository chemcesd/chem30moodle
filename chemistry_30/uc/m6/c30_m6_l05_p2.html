  There is  plastic in almost everything around you. Plastics are <strong>polymers</strong>&mdash;macromolecules  created by linking many smaller molecules. The small molecules that make up a  polymer are called <strong>monomers</strong>. The  process of joining monomers together is called <strong>polymerization</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>polymer:</strong> a  large molecule made by linking together many smaller molecules called monomers</p>

  In Lesson 1 of this module you organized diagrams of the chemical structures for different petrochemical compounds based on structural similarities. In this activity you will review those diagrams to learn more about polymers. Retrieve those diagrams now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sort through the diagrams and find the molecules with the term &ldquo;poly&rdquo; in their name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sort through the remaining diagrams. For each polymer identified in Step 1, find the card that contains the corresponding monomer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 1.</strong> Prepare a chart with two columns. The left-hand column should be titled &ldquo;Polymer&rdquo; and the right-hand column should be titled &ldquo;Corresponding Monomer.&rdquo; Complete the chart based on your work in Steps 1 and 2. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Identify the similarity between all the monomers listed in your table. Suggest a mechanism by which the monomers can be joined to become a polymer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> Sort through the remaining cards and identify any other substances that could be monomers. Justify why you chose these molecules.</p>

<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> All monomers have a double bond  between adjacent carbon atoms. The monomers would  combine through an addition reaction in which the double bond is broken and each  atom is saturated by bonding to another atom (in this case, the carbon atom of  another monomer with a free-bonding electron).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> Other possible monomers are  ethylene and butadiene. Both of these substances have double bonds and could  participate in addition reactions with other monomers.</p>

<p>As you have seen from this Self-Check activity, there are many kinds of polymers. Polymers made from petrochemicals are often called plastics because they have the ability to be moulded. You may be familiar with other kinds of polymers, like polyester, which will be discussed in Lesson 6.  As you may have guessed, polyesters have a different chemistry than addition polymers, the topic of this lesson. <br />

<p>Plastics form part of almost every product you use, and they have  added convenience to many areas of  your life. Cars, computers, cell phones, water bottles, and baby bottles all contain  plastic. Even most of your food and toiletries come in plastic containers. As a  result, even with recycling programs, many landfills are full of plastic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D 1. </strong>Think about  everything you have learned so far in Module 6. Do you think  the way society  uses plastics is a good use of the natural resource from which plastics originate? Write a few paragraphs to provide your opinion  on  this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post your response to the discussion area for your class. Read the  responses of at least two other students. Identify similarities and differences  in the responses you read. Save a copy of your opinion and the similarities and  differences you identified in your course folder.<br />
