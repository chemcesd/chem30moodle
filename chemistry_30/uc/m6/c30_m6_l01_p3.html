<h6><img src="../icons/read.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Read</h6>

<h6>Identifying Additional Perspectives</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that you are living in the &ldquo;Age of Oil&rdquo; but, given that petroleum reserves are not infinite, there is a great deal of concern about what is being done with the resources that remain. Retrieve the  document you created earlier in this lesson to record perspectives, evidence, and arguments on whether society should be saving more fossil fuels for future use as petrochemicals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3. </strong>Use the Internet to find more information on this subject. Remember to include audio and video from respected sources in your search to make sure you find documentaries and programs of interest. Try the search term &ldquo;audio + CBC + age of oil&rdquo; in a search engine. Review one of the websites your search returns. In your document, record  the perspectives introduced and the supporting evidence and arguments. Save your work in your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><img src="../icons/self_check.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Self-Check</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you found in the last module, the ability to represent organic molecules as chemical structures is very important. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3. </strong>Complete  &ldquo;Section 10.1&rdquo; question 1 on page 416 of the textbook.  You may wish to use molecular models when completing this question.  If you are using materials in your home or classroom to build your models, remember that each carbon atom makes four bonds, each hydrogen and chlorine atom makes one bond, and each oxygen atom can make two bonds to other atoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 4. </strong>Complete &ldquo;Section 10.1&rdquo;  question 2 on page 416 of the textbook to add to your research on the petrochemical industry and the use of petroleum. What perspective is  represented in this question?</p>

    <p><strong>Section 10.1 2.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>For every 11 jobs in an ethene plant, 17 700  potential jobs are created.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>When ethane-containing  natural gas is exported, the jobs in the ethane plant and those generated by  the multiplier effect are also exported.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The cost of ethane to  plants will increase as will the cost of ethane products to consumers. The reduced  availability of ethane will result in a lower supply of products made from ethane,  possibly further increasing the price of the products. The high cost of these products would  eventually result in a lowered demand for them and, therefore, job losses in  the industry.</li>

<p>Is society close to running out of crude oil? What  will be the consequences when the crude oil supply is depleted? In this lesson  you have been exposed to different perspectives on these questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D 1. </strong>Write a few  paragraphs about your opinion on these questions, and post them to the  discussion area for your class. Read the responses of at least two other  students. Compare those responses to your own, and identify similarities and differences between them. Save  a copy of your opinion and the similarities and differences you identified in your  course folder.<br />

<p><br />
  Retrieve your copy of the Module 6: Lesson 1 Assignment  that you saved to your computer earlier in this lesson. Complete the Assignment  and save it in your course folder. You will receive information later in the  lesson on when to submit your work to your teacher.</p>
