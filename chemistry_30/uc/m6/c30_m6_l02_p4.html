  What  does it look like when an alkene reacts and undergoes an addition  reaction? View the video &ldquo;Double Bonds&rdquo;  to  find out. As  you watch the video, carefully observe changes that occur to the substances  involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the results of the test performed at the end of the video to answer  Try This questions 3&ndash;6.</p>

<p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Prepare a data table for  the tests performed during the investigation &ldquo;Double Bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 4.</strong> Write the balanced  chemical equation for the reaction between cyclohexene and bromine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 5.</strong> Which substance, corn oil  or octane, contains double bonds? Use  the evidence from the investigation to support your answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 6.</strong> Fats that contain double  bonds are often called unsaturated fats.  A common test to determine the extent of the unsaturation is to perform  a titration using the halogen iodine. It  is observed that a 1:1 mole ratio exists between the moles of iodine that will  react to the moles of double bonds in the fat.  Explain why such a relationship is observed.</p>
