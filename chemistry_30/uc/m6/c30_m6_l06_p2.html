<p>You  have probably heard of polyester. Many fabrics are made from this polymer, which is formed  by linking monomers with the ester functional group. In this activity you will  learn more about the structure of a polyester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retrieve the diagrams of the chemical structures of the petrochemical compounds you started using in Lesson 1. Find the diagrams with the chemical structures for the following molecules:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>ethanol</li>
  <li>isopropanol</li>
  <li>ethylene glycol</li>
  <li>acetic acid</li>
  <li>adipic acid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Using structural formulas,  write balanced chemical equations to describe the six esters that can be formed using  these components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2. </strong> Recall that a polymer is a  long molecule often containing thousands of monomers. Which one of the esters you  wrote in TR 1 has the potential to continue to react to form a long molecule?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Write the balanced chemical equation for the formation of a polymer using the monomers identified in TR 2.  Ensure that the polymer you show in your answer has at least two of each of the monomer molecules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your work in your course folder, and submit  a copy of your response to TR 3 to your  teacher.</p>

<p>In  the Try This activity you just completed, you identified that a polymerization  reaction can involve a reaction other than an addition reaction. Condensation  polymers and <strong>condensation polymerization</strong> reactions are very common in industry  and in biological systems. Read pages 449&ndash;452 in the textbook to learn more  about condensation polymers and polymerization reactions.</p>

  The  unsaturated lipids have a trigonal planar shape around the double bonds, making  it more difficult for the molecules to aggregate into a solid. This results in  lower melting points than those of the corresponding saturated lipids.</p>

  The  reactions to form fats and to form polyesters are similar because, in both  cases, linkages are formed by &ldquo;condensing out&rdquo; water molecules. The reactions are different in that fats are only  <span class="nowrap">tri-esters,</span> whereas polyesters contain many monomer units.</p>

<p>Cloth or disposable diapers?  This might be a decision that you have to make in the future as you become a parent.  Read through &ldquo;Explore an issue&rdquo; on page 455 in the textbook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D 1. </strong>In a  document, indicate whether you will support cloth diapers or disposable diapers, and list supporting facts. Next, include some insight into making your product choice more green. What materials or processes could be used to make your choice of diaper more environmentally sound? </p>

<p>Post your response in the discussion area for your class, and respond to the opinions of at least two students who do not share your viewpoint. Save your work in your course folder.<br />
