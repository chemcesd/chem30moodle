<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are       petrochemicals?</li>
  <li>What       kinds of products result from Alberta&rsquo;s       petrochemical industry? </li>
</ul>
<p>Hydrocarbons found in petroleum can be modified  to create new substances. Approximately 5% of the natural gas and crude oil  harvested in Alberta  is used as feedstock to create petrochemicals. Petrochemicals include all chemicals  that are produced from petroleum. Plastics,  synthetic clothing, shingles, cosmetics, paint, carpets, fertilizers, adhesives,  and pharmaceuticals are examples of petrochemical products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Petrochemicals are one way to use the hydrocarbons  found in petroleum. As you work through Module 6 you will continue to collect  information and consider different perspectives on how society can best use the  hydrocarbons found in petroleum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
