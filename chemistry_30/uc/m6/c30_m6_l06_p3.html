<p><strong>Proteins</strong>&mdash;key components of plants  and animals&mdash;are another type of natural polymer. Proteins are formed when many  amino acids are joined together using an <strong>amide  functional group </strong>between monomers.</p>

<p><strong>Nylon</strong>  is a synthetic polymer that is also created using amide groups between  monomers. Nylon was created as a substitute for silk and is very strong. Nylon is  used to create ropes, parachutes, and as you well know, many of the clothes you wear.</p>

<p><strong>SC 2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Practice 18.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  There are hydroxyl (-OH) functional  groups present in glucose and fructose molecules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 19.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Cellulose  and starch are polysaccharides. The rigid, layered structure of cellulose provides  support to plants and plant cells. Because its single chains are small enough  to be soluble and mobile, starch serves as a means of storing and transporting  energy in plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 20.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Sugars are small molecules  and are readily soluble because of strong intermolecular bonding with solvent  water molecules. Starch is a polymer of the simple sugar glucose. While  starch&rsquo;s helical shape and single-strand structure allow it to be soluble, it  is not as soluble as sugars.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Cellulose has a different  structure than starch. Cellulose is composed of linear polymer chains that  can align side by side and favour interchain hydrogen bonding, thus creating a rigid, inflexible structure.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Practice 21.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Carbohydrate  molecules can be recognized by their ring structure, which has an oxygen atom in  the ring and numerous hydroxyl (-OH) groups attached to the ring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 22.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Sugar  molecules form stronger intermolecular bonds than do hydrocarbons because of their  polarity and ability to hydrogen bond. The shape of sugar molecules also allows  them to readily fit into a crystal lattice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 23.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Glucose  is highly soluble, starch is slightly soluble, and cellulose is insoluble. Glucose  is highly soluble because it is a small, polar, hydrogen-bonded compound that  readily forms intermolecular bonds with water molecules. Although starch is a  polymer, its single chains are small enough to be <span class="nowrap">water-soluble.</span> Also a  polymer, cellulose is insoluble because of its bulky, inflexible structure made  of layered sheets.</p>
