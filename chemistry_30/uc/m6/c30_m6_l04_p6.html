<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p><br />
  In this lesson you learned about carboxylic acids  and esters, two classes of organic compounds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are carboxylic       acids and esters? </li>
  <li>
    <p>How are carboxylic       acids and esters involved in the petrochemical industry?    </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>During  this lesson you synthesized an ester in a laboratory investigation, and you calculated  the atom economy of an esterification reaction. Many chemical industries synthesize  organic compounds such as carboxylic acids and esters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chemical industries consider atom  economy and other principles of green chemistry when developing their processes  to improve their scientific and business practices and to reduce their environmental impact.<strong></strong> In Lesson 6 you will apply your knowledge from this lesson to investigate polymers&mdash;both natural and synthetic&mdash;that are produced by esterification reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>atom economy:</strong> the percentage of material present in  reactants that ends up in the desired product for a chemical process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>carboxylic acids:</strong> a family of organic compounds  characterized by the carboxyl group <span class="nowrap">(&ndash;COOH)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>esterification reaction:</strong> a  chemical reaction in which a carboxylic acid and an alcohol combine to produce  an ester and water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>esters:</strong> a family of organic compounds characterized  by the ester functional group <span class="nowrap">(&ndash;COO&ndash;)</span></p>
