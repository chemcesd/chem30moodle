<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>hydrocarbon  derivative:</strong> a molecular compound of carbon, at least one other element, and, usually, hydrogen</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>functional group:</strong> a characteristic arrangement of  atoms or bonds within a molecule that determines the most important chemical  and physical properties of a class of compounds</p>
</div>
<p>In Lesson 1 you examined the chemical structures of many petrochemicals, and you organized the petrochemicals into groups. Can you recall what strategy you used to group these molecules? Did your strategy involve grouping all the molecules that had halogen atoms into one group and   all the structures with oxygen atoms into another group?  If so, you were grouping the petrochemicals into <strong>hydrocarbon derivative</strong> families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atoms other than carbon or hydrogen, or the presence of  multiple bonds between carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, create a <strong>functional group</strong>. In this module  you will learn about the functional groups  present in common petrochemical compounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may recall from &ldquo;Figure 2&rdquo; on page 413 that petrochemical derivatives are created by altering  hydrocarbons (or primary petrochemicals). Compare the following two illustrations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="60%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td class="tablehead_uc"><p align="center">Hydrocarbon</p></td>
    <td class="tablehead_uc"><p align="center">Petrochemical Derivative</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="left">
      <p class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m6/c30_m6_013_l.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="112" /></p>
      </div></td>
    <td><p class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m6/c30_m6_014_l.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="110" class="unitD" /></p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How could you use the hydrocarbon on the left to  create the molecule on the right? Describe the changes that need  to occur to make the molecule on the left transform into the one on the right.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m6/c30_m6_015_l.jpg" alt="This is an image of the Periodic Table of Elements. The Halogen Family, Group 17, is highlighted and includes fluorine, chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, and Astatine." width="633" height="403" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC"><strong>organic  halide:</strong> an organic compound in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms has  been replaced by halogen atoms</div>
<p>Organic compounds that contain halogen atoms are grouped as <strong>organic halides</strong>. Organic halides contain one or more atoms from the halogen group of  elements. As mentioned in Get Focused, chlorofluorocarbons are an  excellent example of an organic halide because the class contains both chlorine and  fluorine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vinyl chloride is another petrochemical example of an organic halide.  As these examples show, an organic halide&rsquo;s name communicates the halogen(s)  present in the substance. Later in this lesson you will learn how to apply the systematic naming system to organic halides.</p>

  Halogen atoms are added to hydrocarbons to produce a  compound with unique properties. Consider the following molecules:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="65%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th width="40%" class="tablehead_uc" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
    <th width="30%" class="tablehead_uc" scope="col"><p align="center">Methane</p></th>
    <th width="30%" class="tablehead_uc" scope="col"><p align="center">CFC Molecule</p></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td><p align="center">CF<span class="subscript">2</span>Cl<span class="subscript">2</span></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="tablehead_uc" scope="row"><strong>Boiling Point (&deg;C)</strong></th>
    <td><p align="center">&minus;161</p></td>
    <td><p align="center">&minus;29.8</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>Can you identify a reason for the difference in  boiling points between these two molecules?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2. </strong>In a refrigeration system, refrigerants are compressed into their liquid  form and allowed to vapourize. Explain how the vapourization of either of the  substances shown in the table would enable them to act as refrigerants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your response in your course folder, and submit a copy to your teacher. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read page 417 in the textbook to learn the effect that adding halogens to a hydrocarbon can have.  Pay careful attention to the last paragraph and &ldquo;Table 1&rdquo;  on page 417 to learn how to apply the systematic naming process to organic halides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through &ldquo;Sample problem 10.1,&rdquo; &ldquo;Communication  example 1,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Communication example 2&rdquo; on page 418 in the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in this lesson you considered the CFC molecule CF<span class="subscript">2</span>Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>.  What is the systematic name for this molecule?  Is it dichlorodifluoromethane or difluorodichloromethane&mdash;which halogen do you list first?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IUPAC rules state that when more than one type of halogen atom appears in a molecule's structure, the halogen prefixes are to be listed in alphabetical order.  Therefore, the systematic name for CF<span class="subscript">2</span>Cl<span class="subscript">2</span> is dichlorodifluoromethane.</p>

<p>You might have used names that contain redundancies; these are still correct. For example,  <span class="nowrap">3-chloro-2-methylprop-1-ene</span> is acceptable for b. above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 3.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Chloroethene has a higher  boiling point than ethene because it has stronger intermolecular forces.  Firstly, it is polar so it exhibits dipole-dipole forces. Secondly, it has more  electrons so its London  forces are stronger.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Chloroethene is likely  more soluble than ethane because it is polar and water is a polar solvent.</li>

  DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, a pesticide),  Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, the non-stick coating used in cookware), and  PVC (polyvinyl chloride, a type of plastic) are other organic halides. Chemical  technologies like these have been very important in the development of your society and to your standard of living. However, there are also concerns related to the use of organic halides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RC 1. </strong>Use the Internet to research organic halides and  possible concerns related to their use. Why is there concern about exposure to  organic halides that contain chlorine (also known as organochlorides)? To  refine your search, try combining the common names of the chemical compounds listed  in the paragraph above with other search terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save relevant information that you collect in your  course folder. You will revisit this information later in Module 6.</p>
