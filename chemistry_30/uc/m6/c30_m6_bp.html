<p>In this module you will focus on the types of chemical reactions used to convert hydrocarbons into other classes of organic compounds. These kinds of reactions are the basis of the petrochemical industry. Like most  industries, the petrochemical industry is interested in &ldquo;greening&rdquo; its practices&mdash;making them more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  As you work through this module you will  investigate how the chemical industry is adapting its processes to reduce the industry&rsquo;s impact on the environment. Some practices to consider when greening chemical processes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent waste.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design processes that reduce or even prevent        waste, have fewer <span class="nowrap">by-products</span> and more of the original material in the        final product (atom economy), and use renewable materials in processes.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop materials that will degrade after use by natural processes        (sunlight or biodegradation)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Reduce the toxicity of compounds.<br />
    <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Design processes that involve less toxic        materials, including solvents.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Design processes so that by-products have low        toxicity.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Improve efficiency. Efficiency can be improved in two ways:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Strive for fewer by-products and less waste products        (improved atom economy).<br />
        </li>
        <li>Increase the use and        development of catalysts to reduce energy requirements for reactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
    </li>
  <li>Consider safety.<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Design systems to reduce the potential for        accidents and accidental exposure.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
</ul>
<p>You will also learn how the green practices described  are applied to chemical reactions&mdash;both the kind you will carry out in a laboratory and those that occur in petrochemical facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="35" height="32" /> Assessment in This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each lesson contains a range of activities and assessment options. These include   assignments, labs, and Self-Check, Try This, Discuss, Reflect and Connect, and   Reflect on the Big Picture activities. Instructions will be provided for each of   these activities so that you can appropriately focus your time and effort. Your   teacher will tell you which assessment options to complete and which responses   to submit for marks or feedback. Remember to save all of your work in your   Chemistry 30 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA) is one of the most common drugs in the world. Aspirin can be made from compounds found in petroleum or from another starting point.  At the completion of Module 6 you will use the knowledge of organic reactions you gain in this module  to analyze two possible processes for manufacturing Aspirin.  The Module 6 Assessment is done as part of the Unit Assessment. You may wish to look at the Unit Assessment before starting Lesson 1.</p>
