<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p><br />
  </p>
<p>It might surprise you to know that one of the foundations of Alberta&rsquo;s petrochemical industry was chlorine.  One of the main reasons that Dow Chemical chose to establish a petrochemical facility in Fort Saskatchewan was the location&rsquo;s proximity to the underground mineral deposits containing NaCl.  The chlorine produced at the Fort Saskatchewan facility was used by another plant at the same facility to produce the organic halides ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride, and polyvinyl chloride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 3 you completed an electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, which produced chlorine gas as a product. You may wish to revisit the Module 3 investigation and &ldquo;The Chlor-Alkali Process&rdquo; on page  648 in the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are organic       halides?</li>
  <li>
    <p>In what reactions are organic halides involved?</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>Organic halides are an important class of organic  compound and are used in a variety  of important technological applications. It will not surprise you that, because  of this importance, large quantities of these substances have been produced in  petrochemical plants in Alberta  and in other parts of the world. Addition and substitution reactions are the two reaction types currently used  to produce organic halides. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organic halides are also at the centre of some  controversy. Plans to rethink how chemicals are made and used may help address concerns. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>addition reaction:</strong> a  type of organic reaction involving an unsaturated hydrocarbon and a small  molecule, usually hydrogen or a halogen, that increases the saturation of the  hydrocarbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</strong> a group of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>functional group:</strong> a characteristic arrangement of  atoms or bonds within a molecule that determines the most important chemical  and physical properties of a class of compounds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>hydrocarbon derivative:</strong> a molecular compound of carbon, at least one other element, and, usually, hydrogen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>organic halide:</strong> an organic compound in which one or  more of the hydrogen atoms has been replaced by halogen atoms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>substitution reaction:</strong> a type of organic reaction involving breaking a carbon-hydrogen bond  and replacing the hydrogen atom with another atom or group of atoms</p>
