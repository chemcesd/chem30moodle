<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p><br />
  In Lesson 6 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How do natural and       synthetic polymers compare?</li>
  <li>What are other       reaction mechanisms by which polymers can be made?</li>
</ul>
<p>There  are many examples of synthetic and natural polymers that can be produced  through condensation polymerization. Specifically, you considered polyester, proteins  and nylon, and carbohydrates and cellulose acetate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  also further considered the effect of the petrochemical industry and its  offshoot industries on the environment, and you took a look at bioplastics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
