<p>The second class of organic molecules that contains oxygen atoms is the <strong>carboxylic acids</strong> family. Read pages 436&ndash;437 in the textbook to  learn more about carboxylic acids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carboxylic acids always contain the carboxyl  functional group, which is illustrated below. Work through &ldquo;Sample problem 10.5&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Communication example 1&rdquo; on page 438 in the textbook.</p>

<p>You might note that in the reaction for biodiesel  shown in Get Focused, the first product&mdash;the carboxylic acid&mdash;is not complete; it is deficient  a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen in question is part of the hydroxyl group, within  the carboxyl group. In Unit D you will learn more about the reactions and  acidity of carboxylic acids. You will also learn how a carboxylic acid can be correctly represented  in the form shown in the biodiesel equation.</p>

</div>
<p>In Module 6 you have studied many kinds of organic reactions including substitution, fermentation, cracking, addition, and elimination. Another major reaction of carboxylic acids is an <strong>esterification  reaction</strong>. Read pages 438&ndash;440 in the textbook to learn about this type of  chemical reaction and its product&mdash;<strong>esters</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through &ldquo;Sample problem 10.6,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sample problem  10.7,&rdquo; and Communication example 2&rdquo; on page 440 in the textbook.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that these two reactions  involve the same reactants and products but are each other&rsquo;s reverse&mdash;one  creates an ester and the other breaks down an ester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, esters are used in making soap.  Animal fats and vegetable oils are esters and are a key ingredient in making soap. When  esters are combined with a strong base, sodium hydroxide for example, and  heated, the reaction creates a salt of a carboxylic acid (the soap), and  glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). </p>

  <li>ethyl  propanoate (from propanoic acid and ethanol)</li>
  <li>methyl  butanoate (from butanoic acid and methanol)</li>
  <li>butyl  methanoate (from methanoic acid and butan-1-ol)</li>
  <li>propyl ethanoate (from ethanoic acid and propan-1-ol)</li>
</ol>
<p>If  you got the two fragments backwards when you named the esters in this question (e.g.,  propyl ethanoate for part a above), try writing the full structural formula for  each&mdash;it will help you get the name right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice 5.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>As shown in &ldquo;Table 2&rdquo; on  page 439 of the textbook, the ester is pentyl butanoate. The acid required is butanoic acid and  the alcohol needed is pentan-1-ol.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>As shown in the same table,  the ester is octyl ethanoate. The acid required is ethanoic acid and the  alcohol needed is octan-1-ol.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Practice 6.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>For each class of  compounds, as the molar mass increases so does the number of electrons. The  increase in the number of electrons strengthens the London forces attracting the molecules to  each other, thus increasing the boiling point.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The alkanes exhibit only London forces. Even  though the esters are polar and have <span class="nowrap">dipole-dipole</span> forces as well as London forces, the effect  is negligible in large molecules where only the small area around the oxygen  atoms is polar.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Of the three classes, only  the carboxylic acids contain the O-H bond. Because this feature gives them  hydrogen bonding, these compounds have stronger intermolecular bonding and,  therefore, higher boiling points.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Yes. Knowledge of London forces,  dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding explain the observed  properties.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The effect of molecular  shape on London  forces must be considered in branched-chain structures.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The line for alcohols would  fall between those of methyl esters and carboxylic acids.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The prediction in part f is verified.  (If you made the wrong prediction, check that you remembered that alcohols have H-bonding.)</li>
