  The  convenience of plastic bags, packaging, and water pipes makes these products a  beneficial use of polyethylene (polyethene). Problems arise from the disposal  of these products. These products take up a lot of space in landfills and often end up in  oceans and lakes where they are a serious hazard to marine life. Using biodegradable  plastics and reusable cloth bags would help reduce these problems.</p>

  Nylon  toothbrushes are less expensive than &ldquo;natural&rdquo; toothbrushes and are more durable. However,  nylon toothbrushes are not biodegradable, and it may be true that they harbour a lot of germs  because they last for such a long time.</p>

  <li>Pasta, containing the  polysaccharide starch, has the synthetic analog cellulose triacetate, also a  polysaccharide.<br />

  <li>Meat, containing the  polyamide protein, has the synthetic analog nylon, also a polyamide.<br />

  <li>Butter, containing the  &ldquo;polyester&rdquo; fat, has the synthetic analog Dacron, a polyester fabric.</li>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Desirable properties of a  polymer used for potting material are the polymer's ability to absorb many times its own  weight in water and to make the absorbed nutrients available to the plants.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>To test water absorption  capacity, one could soak equal masses of the two polymers in water, filter each  mixture to drain off excess water, and then reweigh the polymers. The mixture with the  greater mass would be the best one with regards to absorption capacity.<br />
    <br />
    To  test the ability to release nutrients, one could grow several identical plants  in two identical containers, each filled with a different polymer.&nbsp;The polymer with the plant that grew the best  over time would be the best one with regards to the ability to release  nutrients.</li>

<p>Sample  solution only; answers will vary as these are opinions and there can be no  right or wrong answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Organic</em>  usually refers to how food is grown or raised. Organic products are generally healthy  and environmentally friendly, so the term is valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Natural</em>  normally describes something as it occurs in nature. An example of the term&rsquo;s  use is &ldquo;natural spring water&rdquo; as opposed to tap water. The term is not very  meaningful and so may not be valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Chemical</em>  is associated with synthetic products like artificial sweeteners. The word  <em>chemical</em> in this context has negative connotations and is usually avoided in advertising  consumer goods. It may not always be valid to interpret<em> chemical</em> negatively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Section 10.5 11.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Starch  is metabolized by humans and so has food value. Cellulose, on the other hand,  cannot be metabolized by humans because their digestive systems do not have the  necessary enzymes to break cellulose down. Because of this, cellulose has virtually  no food value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Section 10.5 12.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Sugars  are very water-soluble in sap because they are relatively small molecules, are  polar, and exhibit hydrogen bonding. Wood is primarily cellulose, a polymer  whose rigid structure of layered sheets makes it insoluble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Section 10.5 13.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  Plastic  bags are superior in some ways to paper bags. The polymer structure of the  plastic is stronger than the polymer structure of the fibres in the paper. Plastic  bags are also lighter and cheaper than paper bags. However, paper bags are more  eco-friendly than plastic bags because they are biodegradable.</p>
