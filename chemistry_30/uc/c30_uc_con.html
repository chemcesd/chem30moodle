<p>In Unit C  you learned about hydrocarbons and their derivatives. You discovered how  important hydrocarbons are to society. Not only do hydrocarbons provide an energy  source, but they can also be chemically manipulated to produce a variety of  organic compounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organic  compounds produced from petroleum are called petrochemicals. Petrochemicals are  used in a wide variety of products ranging from structural materials to  medicines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You investigated the following module questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 5</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is petroleum?
  </li>
  <li>What does Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry do?
  </li>
  <li>Where do hydrocarbons come from?
  </li>
  <li>What are hydrocarbons and what makes them such an important class of compounds?
  </li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within Alberta&rsquo;s petroleum industry?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What impact does the hydrocarbon industry have on Alberta&rsquo;s economy and environment?</li>
  </ul>
<p>Module 6<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kinds of chemical reactions are used to  manipulate hydrocarbons in order to produce petrochemicals?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How has the chemical industry responded to  concerns about the environment?<br />
  </li>
  <li>What are some of the processes that occur within  Alberta's petrochemical industry?</li>
  </ul>
<p>You also investigated the local,  provincial, national, and international impacts of the petroleum industry from a  variety of perspectives, and you learned about the practices to be considered when  greening chemical processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crucial to these changing  practices is  the type of materials being produced, the toxicity of the materials,  and the toxicity of by-products and other waste. Efficiency of reactions must also be considered. Efficiency can be achieved by using processes that have  greater atom economy  and by developing processes that use less energy and have a higher  percentage reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>identify and explain how organic compounds are a common form of matter</li>
  <li>describe chemical reactions of organic compounds</li>
</ul>
<h6><img src="icons/self_check.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Self-Check</h6>
<p><br />
  Complete the <a href="c30_uc_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit C Diagnostic Self-Check</a> to review the concepts, skills, and knowledge introduced and to assess your understanding of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have trouble answering any of the questions, try one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the lesson(s) indicated for each question. Once there, review the information provided and the relevant sections of the textbook.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>View the hint associated with each question.</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li>Look at the answer and then work backward to understand the problem and its solution.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Ask your teacher for help.</li>
  </ul>
  You understand how important it is to review material in preparation for any tests your teacher may give you and in solidifying your understanding of new concepts. Completing these questions is just one part of your review. Program of Studies information is associated with each question. You may wish to use this information to identify areas in which you need to pay particular attention. You may also answer the questions that appear at the end of each chapter and unit in the textbook.</p>
<p> <br />
  You have already reviewed your Modules 5 and 6 concept maps or graphic organizers. Now is a good time to give them another look and add any new connections or ideas to them.</p>
