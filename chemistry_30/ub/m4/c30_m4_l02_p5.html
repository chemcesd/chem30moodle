<p>Rechargeable  cells are also popular in many applications including cellular telephones,  video cameras, and personal music players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One type  of rechargeable cell is the nickel-cadmium cell. The advantage of  nickel-cadmium batteries is that they have a relatively low internal resistance  and can therefore supply high surges of current when necessary. They are also  relatively easy to recharge. The main disadvantage of nickel-cadmium cells  is that they typically have a lower cell potential&mdash;1.2 V as compared to  alkaline dry cells, which have a measured potential of 1.5 V.<br />

<p>Alkaline  cells and other cells using zinc and manganese oxide as reactants are not  rechargeable; some cells even come with warnings to prevent users from  trying to recharge them. Later in this module you will learn more about the  process of recharging cells and about why this process cannot be accomplished with  all consumer cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lithium ion cells are popular in small, portable  devices like cellular telephones and digital cameras, which require short  bursts of significant amounts of electrical energy. Lithium ion  cells are typically composed of a lithium electrode, a graphite electrode  (a form of carbon), and one of several possible electrolytes.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common wet cells in use today are lead-acid  batteries used in automobiles. Lead-acid batteries are useful for automobiles  because they are relatively cheap and easily recharged. The disadvantage of a lead-acid battery relates to its chemical contents&mdash;lead and concentrated sulfuric acid.  Both substances can cause harm.  Considerable caution needs to be exercised when this type of battery is transported, handled, and disposed of. <br />
