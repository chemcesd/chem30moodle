<p>Chances are that the  most-used type of commercial electric cell you found in the &quot;battery&quot; audit you conducted in Lesson 1 was a type of dry cell. In the Reflect and Connect section of Lesson 1 you  read about &ldquo;dry cells,&rdquo; cells in which the quantity of water within the cell has been  reduced, but the properties of the electrolytes have been maintained. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A  modification of the dry cell is the alkaline dry cell. The modification did not  affect the measured cell potential, but it did improve the performance of the cell.  Go to &ldquo;Table 2&rdquo; on page 616 of the textbook and read the information comparing the  dry cell to the alkaline dry cell. Can you classify the  &ldquo;Characteristics and uses&rdquo; for the alkaline dry cell listed in the table according to perspective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alkaline  cells use KOH as an electrolyte, which forms a basic, or alkaline, solution.  Recall that as the concentration of OH<span class="superscript">-</span>  increases in a solution, the concentration of H<span class="superscript">+</span> is reduced. Basic  electrolytes, therefore, reduce the possibility that H<span class="superscript">+</span> ions will  act as an oxidizing agent in the battery. In other words, alkaline batteries  tend to last longer before &ldquo;going dead.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alkaline cells typically produce a  potential that is comparable to a zinc-carbon cell (approximately 1.5 V).  However, the electrolyte in a zinc-carbon cell is slightly acidic. This makes the zinc-carbon cell somewhat inefficient because both H<span class="superscript">+</span> ions and the intended oxidizing  agent are reduced. Because of the low concentration of H<span class="superscript">+</span> ions and the  undesirable reaction they promote, alkaline cells can deliver significantly  higher currents. This combination of higher current and  longer life is a very desirable characteristic for batteries that run devices  like CD players, calculators, and smoke alarms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer cells are most often evaluated in terms of  their durability and convenience. When it comes to batteries, social  perspectives, which demand that portable communication devices  like cellular telephones stay connected, have a much higher priority than, say, environmental perspectives, which consider the consequences of using all these batteries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at the picture shown. Have you ever seen a cell in this condition?  Sometimes an alkaline dry cell may leak contents as a result of a faulty seal in its construction.  How should you deal with a leaking cell of this type?  Use a variety of resources  (e.g., textbook, Materials Safety Data Sheets, Internet) to research how a leaking alkaline dry cell should be safely removed from an electronic device and disposed of. Prepare disposal instructions  that you could provide to a family member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save any information about concerns or procedures for disposal of waste from alkaline dry cells or other  cells in your course folder.  You may refer to this information later in this lesson as you consider the environmental impact of using these cells.</p>
