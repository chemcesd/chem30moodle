<p>The development of electric  cells was essential to experimentation using electrolytic cells. To learn more  about this relationship and how electrolysis can be used to produce elements,  read pages 646&ndash;647 in the textbook. Stop reading when you get to the end of &ldquo;Communication  example 3&rdquo; on page 647. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reading  introduces an important aspect of the electrolysis of weak oxidizing agents  like the ions of group I metals. Because water is a stronger oxidizing agent than <span class="nowrap">Na</span><span class="superscript">+</span><span class="nowrap">(aq), K</span><span class="superscript">+</span><span class="nowrap">(aq)</span>, and  <span class="nowrap">Li</span><span class="superscript">+</span><span class="nowrap">(aq)</span>  the production of metals in group I can only be achieved in molten conditions.   You will recall that ionic compounds also tend to have high melting temperatures, normally well above the boiling point of water.  When molten, ionic compounds such as NaCl(l) act as an electrolyte because ions are free to move. As you have already learned in this module, the movement of ions is essential for the conservation of charge in both electric and electrolytic cells. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Production of Aluminium&rdquo; on pages 647&ndash;648 in the textbook to see how an electrolytic cell containing molten contents is designed and operated.  Then read  &ldquo;The Chlor-Alkali Process&rdquo; on page 648 to learn how chlorine is produced at an industrial scale in a facility such as Dow Chemical in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Unit C of this course you will learn how chlorine produced by the chlor-alkalai process can be used in chemical reactions with hydrocarbons to make plastics. The partnering of industrial processes like the chlor-alkali process with the refining of petroleum is an important part of Alberta&rsquo;s petrochemical industry.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p> From an aqueous solution, trying to reduce a metal ion (which is a weaker oxidizing agent than water) is futile. When water is the strongest oxidizing agent present, it will be reduced and the metal ion will remain unchanged in the solution. Also, many ionic compounds have low solubility in water, which makes it impractical to electrolyze an aqueous solution to obtain a metal. The technological solution is to conduct the electrolysis in the absence of water; which is possible by melting the ionic compound.</p>

       <p> Recycling aluminium has many  benefits. To recycle an aluminium can, it takes only 5% of the energy required  to produce a new one. Because every method for producing electrical  energy has negative consequences, this energy saving reduces the aluminium industry&rsquo;s impact  on the environment. Recycling aluminium also saves bauxite, the  mineral from which aluminium is obtained. This preserves bauxite for future  generations. Recycling also reduces the amount of waste going into landfills.</p>

<p>Electrolytic cells can also  be used to refine metals. Read  &ldquo;Refining of Metals&rdquo; on pages 649&ndash;650  of the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people have been  attracted to the glowing chrome on classic and customized automobiles. The  process of placing chromium over the steel used to construct bumpers  and other parts of a car&rsquo;s body is called electroplating.</p>
