<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="32" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>How  much do you rely on batteries in your everyday life?</li>
  <li>What  are the components of a voltaic cell?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the  beginning of this lesson you conducted an audit of the different types  of commercial cells used in your house. Did your reliance on commercial cells  surprise you or did you just take for granted that battery use is part of  modern-day life? How were you impacted when you calculated the mass of chemical waste generated by spent commercial cells disposed of by your class or by your community?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  lesson you  learned about the parts of a voltaic cell and how these parts  work together to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. You learned   how to use the &ldquo;Table of Selected Standard Electrode Potentials&rdquo; (also used in Module 3) to predict the strongest oxidizing and reducing agents in the  system. You used the information from this table to write the half-reactions  that occur while the cell is functioning. You also completed a virtual  investigation in which you explored the connections between half-cells and the  observable changes that occur when a voltaic cell operates.</p>
