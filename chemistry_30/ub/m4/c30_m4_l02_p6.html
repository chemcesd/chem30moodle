<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you completed an audit of the cells used in your  home. In this lesson you investigated common types of  consumer cells.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RBP 1. </strong>Retrieve your  &ldquo;battery&rdquo; audit and classify the cells you counted into the following categories:  rechargeable and non-rechargeable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many cells and batteries are discarded improperly.  In this lesson you learned that some of the components of various  types  of cells can be toxic or may cause harm to the environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RBP 2. </strong>Research the  following types of commonly used cells and batteries, and identify concerns  about their disposal: </p>
<ul>
  <li>alkaline dry cell (zinc-manganese oxide)</li>
  <li>nickel-cadmium </li>
  <li>nickel-metal hydride </li>
  <li>lithium ion</li>
  <li>lead-acid</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare a poster, information pamphlet, podcast, or  other form of communication to promote safer practices for the disposal of used  cells and batteries in your local area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><img src="../icons/discuss.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Discuss</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place a copy of your poster, pamphlet, or presentation in the discussion area for your class.  Review the presentations of other students in your class, and provide constructive feedback to your classmates in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the scientific information correct?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Does the presentation address  concerns about the disposal of different types of spent cells?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Are effective communication strategies used?  How might the presentation of information be improved?</li>
</ul>
<p>Review the feedback you receive on your own presentation, and revise your presentation.   Submit your final presentation to your teacher.</p>
