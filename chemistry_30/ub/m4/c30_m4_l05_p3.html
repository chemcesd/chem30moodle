<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you learned how to use quantitative information related to the operation of an electrochemical cell to predict the amount of species participating in the reaction. Throughout this module you have considered the environmental impact of electrochemical processes.  Like other chemical processes, the properties and quantity of chemical waste are important in determining appropriate treatment methods.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future research in the area of environmental chemistry or in other scientific areas  may change opinions regarding the harm that some forms of chemical waste  may cause.  For example, alkaline dry cells collected at Eco Station facilities in Edmonton are currently placed in a special landfill;  depending on future developments in technology for recycling, these alkaline dry cells may be unearthed and processed.  It is very possible that the processing of waste from alkaline dry cells will involve further electrochemical reactions, possibly even electrolysis. Therefore, a knowledge of quantitative relationships in electrochemical processes is certain to be an important part of any efforts to recycle this type of waste.</p>
