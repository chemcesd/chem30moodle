<p>In Lesson 4 you learned that electrolytic cells can be used to produce measurable quantities of elements, including gases and electroplated metals.  As you completed the virtual investigation &ldquo;Electroplating Copper,&rdquo; did you find yourself wondering about the changes to the mass of each  electrode in the cell?  In this lesson you will revisit the data you collected from the Lesson 4 virtual investigation, and you will research other electrolytic cells. You will   investigate the stoichiometric relationships involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your work in previous chemistry courses and in earlier modules of this course, you will recall that stoichiometry is a process that can be used to predict and explain the chemical and measurable quantities of matter involved in a process.  Can you think of how stoichiometric principles could be applied to an electrochemical reaction occurring in an electric or   electrolytic cell?   Is it possible to have a quantitative relationship between electrons and the atoms involved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete Lesson 5:</p>
<ul>
  <li> What are the important quantitative relationships within operating electric and electrolytic cells?</li>
</ul>

<p>Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m4_l05_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 4:  Lesson 5 Assignment</a>  to your computer now. You will receive further instructions on how to complete  this assignment later in the lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the   teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback that   you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all the   questions and place those answers in your course folder.</p>
