<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Voltaic  Cells and Batteries </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will  learn about the scientific principles involved in the construction and function  of voltaic cells, a type of commercial electric cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  will investigate the following  lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much do you  rely on batteries in your everyday life?</li>
  <li>What are the  components of a voltaic cell?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Design of  Commercial Cells </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  Lesson 2 you will investigate the construction of different types of  commercial and consumer cells used by society, and you will consider the environmental  impact of your personal battery use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why are there so  many different designs and types of electrochemical cells?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Electrolytic  Cells </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lessons 1 and 2 will explain the chemical change that occurs within a voltaic cell. But how can  you make a cell rechargeable? In Lesson 3 you will learn about rechargeable  cells and why some cells are rechargeable and others are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  will investigate the following  lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is an  electrolytic cell?</li>
  <li>What chemical  and energy conversions occur within an electrolytic cell?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Commercial  Applications of Electrolytic Cells </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you will  learn about industrial applications of electrolysis, and you will learn  how this technology can  be applied to the extraction of elements and to the refining and electroplating of  metals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  will investigate the following  lesson question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of  the practical applications of electrolytic cells?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Quantitative  Relationships in Cells </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you will  record and analyze qualitative changes within electric and electrolytic cells. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  will investigate the following  lesson question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the  important quantitative relationships within operating electric and electrolytic  cells?</li>
</ul>
