  What is the connection between electrolysis and the &ldquo;recharging&rdquo; that occurs within a rechargeable commercial cell?  A rechargeable commercial cell does not allow new materials to enter or leave the cell. Therefore, the application of electrical energy used in recharging the cell must create a chemical change. The chemical change  recreates the reactants of the spontaneous reaction that produces the flow of electrons. The spontaneous reaction that produces the flow of electrons is referred to as the discharge of the cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reactions for the discharge of the cell and its recharging are reversible. The products of one process become the reactants for the next process. The process of discharging and recharging can  be repeated many times, provided an energy source is available for the non-spontaneous recharging process, and that the half-reactions in the discharging process are reversible and recreate the reactants.</p>

<p>Use the information in the Read section above to complete the following questions. Use complete descriptions. Where possible, make reference to the  information provided to support your answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RBP 1.</strong> The discharge of a Ni-Cd  rechargeable cell is described by the following half-reactions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 NiO(OH)(s) + 2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l)  + 2 e<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span> &rarr;  2 Ni(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s) + 2 OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>E</em>&ordm;<span class="subscript">net</span> = +0.49 V</p>
<p> Cd(s) + 2 OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq) &rarr; Cd(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s) + 2 e<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>E</em>&ordm;<span class="subscript">net</span> =  &ndash;0.81 V</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrange the half-reactions  to determine the net reaction and the net cell potential for the discharge of a Ni-Cd cell. What  are the products of the recharging process, and what is the minimum voltage  that must be applied to a recharging Ni-Cd cell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><img src="../../images/m4/015_battery_warning.jpg" alt="A photograph shows the warning label on the side of a consumer dry cell. The label reads &ldquo;Caution This battery is not rechargeable.

  <p><span class="caption">The warning label reads &ldquo;This battery is not rechargeable. May explode or leak if charged or it +- terminals are connected in reverse.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>RBP 2. </strong>The half-reactions for a common  type of dry cell are shown below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cathode: MnO<span class="subscript">2</span>(s) +  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l) + 2 e<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span> &rarr; Mn<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">3</span>(s) + 2 OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)</p>
<p>anode: Zn(s) &rarr; Zn<span class="superscript">2+</span>(aq) + 2 e<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cell  shown in the photograph  has a prominent warning label. Provide reasons for the warning shown  in the picture, and explain why it  is not physically possible to recharge this type of cell. &nbsp;</p>
