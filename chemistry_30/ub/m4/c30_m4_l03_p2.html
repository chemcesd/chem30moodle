<p>In previous science courses you may have seen how applying electrical energy to a solution caused chemical change.  Electrolysis, the process of applying an electrical current to a system, is used to cause chemical reactions.  In Lesson 2 you learned that electric cells, voltaic cells for example, involve a spontaneous electrochemical change.  What kind of change occurs in an  electrolytic cell? Read pages 639&ndash;640 in the  textbook to learn about the scientific principles behind the operation of an  electrolytic cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to save a copy  of &ldquo;Table 1&rdquo; from page 640 in your course folder as a reminder of the  similarities and differences between the two types of electrochemical cells: electric and electrolytic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a clear understanding of the differences between the behaviours of electric and electrolytic cells,&nbsp; read  &ldquo;Secondary Cells: Electric  and Electrolytic&rdquo; on page 640 of the textbook.  Does it make sense that a rechargable cell can be described as both an  electric and an electrolytic cell, but that the cell can't be both at the same time?&nbsp; </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 1.</strong> At the cathode of an electrolytic cell, the oxidizing agent gains electrons and  is reduced. At the anode of the cell, the reducing agent loses electrons and is  oxidized.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 2.</strong> In a voltaic cell, the cathode and anode are designated positive and negative  respectively. In an electrolytic cell, the designations are the opposite.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 3.</strong> In an electrolytic cell, electrons move through the external circuit from anode  to cathode. Cations migrate toward the cathode, and anions migrate toward the  anode.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Practice 4. </strong>The  pumping of water into the tower is similar to the recharging of a secondary  cell because energy is applied to drive a change (by applying a current to force a  chemical reaction to occur in the cell). When water flows from the tower, it  does so due to gravity. This  spontaneous process is similar to the discharging of  the secondary cell in which the chemical energy is converted into electrical  energy.</p>

<p>In the next activity you  will watch a video showing the electrolysis of a solution. The system you will observe  is an aqueous potassium iodide solution that will be placed in a U-tube. A carbon  electrode will be placed in each end of the tube. The carbon electrodes will be  connected to a source of electricity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the following questions about the system before you view the video. The questions will  prepare you to anticipate the events and changes you will observe in  the video. As you complete the questions, recall the techniques that you used to predict redox reactions and that you applied in your study of voltaic cells.  Remember to carefully scan the states of substances in half-reactions, as they may help you identify observable changes that will occur as the cell operates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> What  are the strongest oxidizing and reducing agents in this system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> What  are the half-reactions for the strongest oxidizing and reducing agents in this  system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Describe  one observable change you would expect to see at each of the electrodes, and describe a  diagnostic test you could perform to confirm the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 4.</strong> Calculate  the <em>E</em>&ordm;<span class="subscript">cell</span> for this system. What does this value represent in terms  of operating the cell?</p>

<p>In previous science courses  you may have seen the electrolysis of water that makes hydrogen and oxygen gases. In  Module 3 you learned about disproportionation reactions, a type of electrochemical reaction in which the same species  acts as the oxidizing and the reducing agent. The electrolysis of water is another  example of a disproportionation reaction.</p>

<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> What  are the oxidation and reduction half-reactions involved in the electrolysis of  water? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 4.</strong> What  technical consideration is necessary to make the electrolysis of water  possible?</p>

    <p><strong>SC 4. </strong>Pure water does not conduct an electric current; therefore, a flow of charge would not be possible within an electrolytic cell containing pure water. Often the water has a small quantity of sodium sulfate added to it prior to electrolysis. The sodium ions and the sulfate ions in the system are spectator ions, but they are essential to allowing the cell to complete the flow of charge necessary for the transfer of electrons to occur.</p>
