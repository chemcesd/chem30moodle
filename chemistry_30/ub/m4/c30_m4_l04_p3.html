<p>Society uses a lot of metal. That makes the industries that use electrolytic cell technology to produce elements and refine and plate metals extremely important. There are toxicity issues associated with some metals and substances used  in electroplating. Careful treatment of chemical waste is essential if these  industries are to demonstrate sustainability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to investigate whether any businesses in your local area electroplate or recycle metals (recycling also often uses electroplating).  How do these businesses deal with chemical waste?  What  provincial and federal laws apply to these businesses? How do these businesses address concerns about protecting the environment?</p>
