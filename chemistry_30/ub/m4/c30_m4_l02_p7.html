<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following  question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you determine the cell potential for a voltaic cell?</li>
</ul>
<p>You learned  how to determine cell potential for a voltaic cell using the electrical  potentials that correspond with the half-reactions listed in the &ldquo;Table of  Selected Standard Electrode Potentials.&rdquo; You completed an investigation to verify the  predictions made for voltaic cells you constructed. You also investigated  different types of consumer cells. You looked at the purpose of each type of cell and at  concerns about their chemical components and proper disposal. </p>
