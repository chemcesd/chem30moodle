<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you have learned a great deal about  the construction of voltaic and other types of electrochemical cells. In this   investigation you will construct voltaic cells, and you will use the techniques you have learned to test predictions that  can be made about voltaic cells.</p>
