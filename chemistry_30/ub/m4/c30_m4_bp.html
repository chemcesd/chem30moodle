<p>It&rsquo;s the end of a long day.  Your end-of-day routine probably includes checking your cell  phone, your MP3 player,  and  a few other devices to see if their batteries need to  be recharged. You probably haven&rsquo;t considered all the other devices in your  home that rely on batteries in order to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><img src="../../images/m4/003_protective_gear.jpg" alt="A photograph shows a person wearing white coveralls and protective gloves sorting discarded electronic materials at a disposal facility for special waste. The person in coveralls has a cordless telephone in one hand and the telephone&rsquo;s rechargeable battery in the other. These items are being placed into separate areas of a large blue bin labeled &ldquo;Chemicals.&rdquo; A discarded computer and other electronic equipment are in the bin." width="305" height="229" /></p>

<p>The batteries in a laptop  computer or in a cordless telephone provide you with great convenience, but at  what cost? While some batteries are rechargeable, others are not. Every battery has a certain lifespan. When a battery reaches the end of its lifespan, it is usually just thrown away without further thought. However, batteries that end up in landfills can leak toxic chemicals into the  environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ever make a trip to  the Eco Station or special <span class="nowrap">waste handling</span> facility in your area, you might be  amazed by how many electronic devices are disposed of. What about  the batteries that powered these devices? Is it time to think about your use of  batteries and to make some changes in how you use them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 4 you will learn  about the design and operation of electrochemical cells. You will apply your understanding of electrochemical change learned in Module 3. You will continue to use tools like the &ldquo;Table of Selected  Standard Electrode Potentials,&rdquo; your ability to predict spontaneous and non-spontaneous reduction-oxidation reactions, and stoichiometry throughout Module 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Assessment in This Module</h4>
<p><br />
  Each lesson contains a range of activities and assessment options. These include   assignments, labs, and Self-Check, Try This, Discuss, Reflect and Connect, and   Reflect on the Big Picture activities. Instructions will be provided for each of   these activities so that you can appropriately focus your time and effort. Your   teacher will tell you which assessment options to complete and which responses   to submit for marks or feedback. Remember to save all of your work in your   Chemistry 30 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Module 4 Assessment you will apply your knowledge of electrochemical systems to investigate a cell constructed using a potato or a lemon.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to look at the Module Assessment and the Unit Assessment before   starting Lesson 1.</p>
