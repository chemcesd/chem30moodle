<p>In the  investigation you just completed you identified the parts of a voltaic cell  and, in combination with your pre-lab work, you identified reactions that  involve different components of the cell. Read page 622 and the top of page 623 of the textbook  to learn more about other necessary components of  voltaic cells and about how voltaic cells are represented.</p>

<p><strong>TR 4.</strong> A silver-copper voltaic cell is  constructed.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Draw a diagram of the cell.  Label the location of the following components: Ag(s), <span class="nowrap">AgNO</span><span class="subscript">3</span><span class="nowrap">(aq),</span>  <span class="nowrap"> Cu(s),</span> <span class="nowrap"> Cu(NO</span><span class="subscript">3</span><span class="nowrap">)</span><span class="subscript">2</span><span class="nowrap">(aq),</span> salt bridge, electrical wire.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Write the reduction half-reaction  occurring in this cell.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Write the oxidation half-reaction  occurring in the cell.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Label the anode and cathode of  the cell.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Use an arrow to indicate the  direction of the flow of electrons along the electrical wire.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>TR 5.</strong> The salt bridge, or porous  boundary, is an essential part of a voltaic cell. Since electrons are exchanged  between the half-cells, ions must also be exchanged in order to conserve  charge.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Predict the direction of the  flow for positively charged ions (cations) with respect to the cathode  half-cell.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Predict the direction of the  flow for negatively charged ions (anions) with respect to the anode half-cell.</li>

<h6>The Voltaic Cell </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>View the  animation &ldquo;<a href="https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/t4tes/courses/senior/chemistry_30/mm/m4/voltaic/voltaic_start.html" target="_blank">The Voltaic Cell</a>.&rdquo; Use the information in the animation to check your answers to questions  TR 4 and TR 5. You may also wish to read pages 623&ndash;624 in the textbook  for another description of the operation of, and changes occurring within, a  silver-copper voltaic cell.</p>

<p>Voltaic  cells can also be constructed with half-cells that do not involve a metal as a  reactant. An inert electrode can be used if a solution contains the strongest oxidizing agent or the strongest  reducing agent in an aqueous form. The term <em>inert</em> means that  the electrode cannot react during the cell&rsquo;s operation. An electrode is only necessary to be an electrical conductor&mdash;to allow for the movement of electrons in a half-cell. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 625&ndash;626 in the textbook to learn how an inert  electrode is used in a voltaic cell. Work through &ldquo;Communication example 1&rdquo; on  page 625 to check your ability to represent the use of an inert electrode in a  voltaic cell.</p>
