<h6>Battery Audit</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform  an audit of the commercial electric cells, or &ldquo;batteries,&rdquo; used in your home. You might identify all of the devices powered by batteries that you or your family  recently used, or you might count the number and types of  cells you replaced recently. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>In a table or spreadsheet, list each type of cell and its  quantity. You might also want to indicate what device the cell came from (e.g., alarm clock) and,  if you can recall, the last time the cell was changed in the device. For devices  that you place on a recharger (e.g., cell phone), you might want to indicate the components of the cell (e.g., lithium ion, nickel-cadmium, metal hydride) and how often you  recharge the cell. Finally, include an estimate of the  quantity of  cells you would use in one year. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your work in your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><img src="../icons/discuss.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Discuss </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place a  copy of your  audit in the discussion area for your class. Look at the totals  submitted by other students. How would you rank your household&rsquo;s  use of batteries relative to that of other households?</p>

<p>In previous chemistry courses you became aware of   chemical waste, which is the product of chemical processes.  In this module you will learn more about the contents of commercial cells and the products of the chemical reactions that occur within them.  Now is a good time to think about the mass of chemical waste products that come from commercial cells.</p>

<p><strong>TR 2.</strong>  Prepare a spreadsheet to calculate the mass of each type of commercial electric cell that is disposed of by two of the following groups of people. You might use the totals  in your  audit or in the audits of your classmates to determine average  use where required.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>your  household
  </li>
  <li>your class
  </li>
  <li>your local community </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TR 3.</strong>  How does your household dispose of spent cells?   Survey other students in your class to see if there are other ways to dispose of spent cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Save a copy of your answers in your course folder. You may be asked to submit a copy  to your teacher for feedback.</p>

<p>Electrochemical  cells are devices built to use the transfer of electrons that drives redox  reactions. The components of an electrochemical cell are the reactants for a  reduction-oxidation process. The design allows the exchange of electrons between  reactants to do work. Keep this principle in mind as you read pages 612&ndash;614 in  the textbook.</p>
