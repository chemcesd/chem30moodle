<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you  considered the following question:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are the important quantitative       relationships within operating electric and electrolytic cells?</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson extended your  application of the stoichiometric method to include amperage and time. You used the stoichiometric method to  determine the chemical quantity of electrons participating in a reaction. Since  electrons determine the chemical changes in these cells, they can be treated as  the limiting reactant in many electrochemical systems. As such, electrons can  be used to calculate the quantities of products or  reactants in the system that participates in the process.</p>
