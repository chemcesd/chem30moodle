<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" alt="Summary" width="36" height="32" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you investigated technological applications of the scientific principles associated with reduction&ndash;oxidation reactions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You considered the following module question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are  principles of oxidation and reduction applied to electrochemical cells?</li>
</ul>
<p>You used your understanding of electron transfer reactions and skills and techniques to predict, explain, and interpret chemical changes in order to investigate electric (e.g., voltaic) and electrolytic cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you found with the chemical systems you investigated in Module 3, the chemical behaviour of both electric and electrolytic cells can be explained using half-reactions, net ionic equations, and cell potentials.  You paid careful attention to the products and reactants in the equations you wrote. This allowed you to make observations that confirmed your predictions for both types of electrochemical cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also learned to apply your knowledge of stoichiometry to  reduction-oxidation reactions occurring in these cells. You extended your  understanding of reaction chemical entities by using information about amperage  and time to calculate moles of electrons participating in a chemical process.  In the case of an electrolytic cell, you regarded electrons as the limiting  reagent in the cell&rsquo;s operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you worked through Module 4, you may have added information to a concept   map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson questions listed in the   Module 4 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time to review the relationships in   your concept map or graphic organizer and to try to answer the module and lesson   questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../../images/pdf_files/m4/027_org_chart.pdf" target="_blank">sample Module 4 concept map</a> shows one set of possible links between the   questions. Remember that this is one possible description only&mdash;there are many   other correct possibilities. However, if your completed concept map or graphic   organizer differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your   teacher or to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your   class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials and your   descriptions are accurate.</p>

<p>When you were in elementary school, you might have constructed an  electrochemical cell using a potato or a lemon. You have come a long way in understanding  electrochemical cells. In this Assessment you will  demonstrate your understanding of the scientific principles and technical knowledge involved in the design and operation of electrochemical cells. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an electrochemical cell made from a potato or a lemon in mind,  investigate ONE of the following  research questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do all cells of this       kind produce the same voltage?</li>
  <li> Do all cells of this       kind operate for the same length of time?</li>
  <li>Can different voltages       be recorded from cells constructed using the same fruit or vegetable?</li>
  <li>Is it possible to make       these kinds of cells using a  wide range of fruits and vegetables?</li>
</ul>
<p>Read through the parts of  conducting an experiment described in the table provided. Formally document your work  in two of these steps, and submit  your documentation to your teacher for assessment. Document your work in the  format that best allows  you to provide accurate,  detailed, and complete descriptions of your work; e.g., video, audio, text, or a combination of formats.  </p>
