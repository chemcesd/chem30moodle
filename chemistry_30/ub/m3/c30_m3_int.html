The first, rust, is shown as an orange discolouration of metal on bolts, links in a chain, and the centre of a school zone traffic sign. The second, patina, is shown as a green discolouration of copper on the heads of copper nails, a brass bell, and the foot of a bonze statue." width="445" height="334" /></p>

<p>Metals are  fantastic materials to use for structural components or for decoration. Sometimes, however, metals react when they are exposed to air, water, or other  substances. In some situations the reaction decreases the performance of the  object. In extreme cases, metal fatigue or failure can have drastic consequences,  such as when metal fatigue causes a large structure to collapse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great deal of  scientific work and technological development has gone into studying metals  and into preventing metal corrosion. If you consider how many of the objects you use involve metals, you will understand why so much attention is placed on understanding corrosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In Module 3 you will investigate the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>What properties of metals make them popular choices  in the construction and production of materials?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>How can an understanding of corrosion allow for  better selection of materials and for development of methods that reduce material  damage?</li>
  </ul>
<p>Remember that each lesson will also be organized around questions intended to   guide your study. As you proceed through Module 3, you may record answers to   these questions and any interrelationships that exist between them in a concept   map or graphic organizer. More information is available in the <a href="../c30_ub_org.html" target="_blank">Unit B Concept Organizer</a>. In   the Module 3 Summary you will receive further information on how you can use   your concept map or graphic organizer to review the concepts you studied in this   module.</p>
