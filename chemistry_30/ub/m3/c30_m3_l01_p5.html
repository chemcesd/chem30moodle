<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding  electrochemical reactions is an important part of successfully using metals as  structural materials. In this lesson you have seen how metals can undergo  electron transfer reactions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RBP 1. </strong>How do metals tend to behave in electrochemical  reactions? What possible consequence might a redox reaction involving a metal have to the substance's integrity? Can you think of ways that electrochemical  reactions of metals can be prevented?</p>
