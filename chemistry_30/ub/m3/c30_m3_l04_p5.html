  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Do various  conditions influence the corrosion of iron? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> To investigate  conditions that influence the corrosion of iron objects and to determine if the  chemical change observed can be explained using concepts discussed in this  module.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Retrieve your copy  of the Module 3: Lesson 4 Assignment that you saved to your computer earlier in  this lesson. Complete Part 2 as you work through the following investigation.  When you have finished, save your completed Assignment in your course folder.  You will receive instructions later on when to complete the rest of this Assignment.</p>

  <p>If you have access to the materials listed, you may be able to perform this   investigation.</p>
  <p><br />
      <img src="../icons/watch_and_listen.gif" width="35" height="31" /> If   you do not have access to these materials and a supervised laboratory, or if you   would like to see the lab performed before you attempt it, view the virtual   investigation &ldquo;<a href="https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/t4tes/courses/senior/chemistry_30/mm/m3/m3_l4_corrosion_iron/m3_l4_corrosion_iron.html" target="_blank">Lesson 4 Lab: Conditions Affecting the Corrosion of Iron</a>.&rdquo; If you will not be   completing the lab youself, remember to record data and observations as you view   the presentation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
  <p><br />
      <strong>Step 1: </strong>Measure 25 mL of acetone.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Clean six  nails with steel wool, and place the nails in the acetone. Use forceps to  remove the nails and then set the  nails on a paper towel to dry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Set six 13 mm &times; 100 mm test tubes in a test tube  rack.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Into five of the test tubes, transfer approximately 6 mL of the following solutions: distilled water,  HCl(aq), NaCl(aq),  NaOH(aq), and deaerated water. Label each test tube with the name of its contents.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Label the sixth test tube &ldquo;air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Place a clean, dry nail in each test tube, and  place a stopper in tubes 5 (dearerated water) and 6 (air).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Set the rack containing the test tubes and  nails aside for 24 hours.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Observe the results, including solution colour,  nail colour, and nail integrity. Record your observation in the data section in  the Module 3: Lesson 4 Assignment.</p>
