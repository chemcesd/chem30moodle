<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="32" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do  some metals appear to react more easily than other metals?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Is it  possible to predict whether an electrochemical reaction will occur  spontaneously?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson you  analyzed data collected from the reaction of metals with solutions of metal  ions, and you developed a list ranking metals and metal ions in terms of their  tendency to react. You also learned how to classify substances as oxidizing and  reducing agents, and you learned how to rank them in terms of their tendency to transfer  electrons. You learned about the spontaneity rule and how to use a table of  redox reactions to predict the outcome of electrochemical reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson <strong></strong>Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>non-spontaneous:</strong> a process that is incapable of proceeding   unless driven by an outside source of energy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>spontaneous:</strong> a process that occurs without any external   energy source </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spontaneous process will occur on its own.</p>
