<p>Corrosion is not the only problem iron presents. Iron is one of the
most plentiful elements in Earth&#8217;s crust; as such, iron can be present
in groundwater. In Alberta and elsewhere, iron can be a problem in well
water. Iron(II) ions give well water a pale yellow-brown colour, and
iron(III) ions can create insoluble precipitates. Iron in water also
gives water a metallic taste and can stain dishes and laundry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people using well water install water treatment systems to
remove iron from their water. A popular method to remove iron from
water involves treating iron with potassium permanganate, <span
 class="nowrap">KMnO</span><span class="subscript">4</span><span
 class="nowrap">(s).</span> How might this system be able to remove
iron(II) ions from well water?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may recall that permanganate ion is a strong oxidizing agent.
When potassium permanganate is pumped into the filter, it brings about
the oxidation of iron(II) ions to iron(III) ions.&nbsp;Iron(III) ions
are poorly soluble in water and precipitate. The precipitate is then
removed by the filter.</p>

net ionic equation for the reaction between potassium permanganate and
iron(II) ions that occurs in the iron filter system. Assume acidic
conditions.</p>

<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> Potassium permanganate in an aqueous solution
at low concentrations has an intense purple colour. How would a

manganese(II) ion at low concentrations is colourless. If appropriate
quantities of permanganate are being used, the water from the iron
filter will appear colourless. If excessive permanganate is used, the
water will appear pink or purple in colour. If not enough permanganate
is used, the water will appear pale yellow-orange in colour due to the
presence of iron(II) ions.</p>

<p> The iron filtration system demonstrates the application of a redox
reaction in a water treatment system. It also demonstrates how
sensitive some processes are to the quantities of substances used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In previous chemistry courses you studied the stoichiometric method
and performed a titration experiment. Can you think of how this water
treatment system is similar to a titration and a stoichiometric
relationship?<br>

<p><strong>SC 4.</strong> In previous chemistry courses you performed
titrations in acid-base systems. You used pH indicators to detect the
endpoint of the titration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explain the following aspects of a titration:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>What unique glassware is used in a titration and what is the
function of each piece?</li>
  <li>What is an endpoint?</li>
  <li>What property of a potassium permanganate solution could be used
as an endpoint for a titration?</li>

<p>Contact your teacher if your answers vary significantly from the
answers provided here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 4.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>a.</strong> A burette (to measure volume of titrant added
to reach endpoint) and a pipette (to deliver a specific volume of
solution of unknown concentration (test solution)) are used in a
titration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The endpoint is a point in a titration when an
observable change in the system occurs. Usually this change is a colour
change, but it can be another change such as a change in pH or
conductivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Colour could be used as an endpoint. The
persistence of the purple MnO<span class="subscript">4</span><span
 class="superscript">-</span>(aq) indicates an excess of permanganate
ion in the solution. Permanganate ion can only exist in excess in the
solution once all of the reactant in the test solution has
reacted.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will recall from your work in previous science courses that a
titration involves adding a solution with a known concentration to a
test solution with an unknown concentration. When you performed a
titration experiment previously, you made careful observations and you
recorded the volume of each solution involved in the reaction. Using
the information about the volumes in addition to the molar
concentration of the titrant allows for calculation of the chemical
quantities involved. You will also recall that knowledge of the
balanced chemical equation for the reaction occurring in the titration
is critical to performing any titration analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the importance of writing redox reactions to performing
quantitative analysis, you may understand why so much emphasis was
placed on learning how to write balanced chemical equations for redox
reactions earlier in this module. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To complete your work in this lesson you will need to join the
following two sets of skills:</p>

  <li>performing stoichiometric calculations using titration data</li>
