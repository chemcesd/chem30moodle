<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when a  metal is involved in a chemical
  reaction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../icons/watch_and_listen.gif" width="35" height="31" /> View the virtual investigation &ldquo;<a href="https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/t4tes/courses/senior/chemistry_30/mm/m3/Zinc/main.html" target="_blank">Observing the Reactivity of Zinc</a>.&rdquo; You  will observe the changes that occur when zinc reacts with a solution of silver  nitrate. Record your observations and answer the Analysis questions as you work through this investigation.  Save a copy of your work in your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction of zinc and aqueous silver nitrate.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Indicate what empirical evidence you observed in the investigation that supports the equation you have written.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Identify which substances have undergone change in this reaction? Is the change the substance(s) underwent an electrochemical change involving a transfer of electrons? Support your  reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next activity, you will read and work through &ldquo;Sample problem 13.1&rdquo; in the textbook. You will be prompted to check your answers to the Analysis Questions after completing your reading.</p>
