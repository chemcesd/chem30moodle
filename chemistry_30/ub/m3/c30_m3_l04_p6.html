  <p>Billions of dollars  are spent every year to prevent or slow the corrosion of iron. The following are some methods to prevent the corrosion of iron. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2blockB"><strong>alloy:</strong> a homogeneous mixture of two or more  metals or of a metal and a metalloid </div>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix metals with  iron to form a more corrosion-resistant <strong>alloy</strong>. Alloys have a unique set of  properties. Stainless steel is  an iron alloy. It contains mostly iron,  between 10% to 30% chromium, a smaller percentage of nickel, and sometimes  cobalt. <br />
      <br />
    </li>
   
    <li>Paint exposed  iron surfaces. Applying a coating  prevents water and oxygen from gaining  access to iron and therefore prevents oxidation of the iron.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    
    <li>Plate iron with  another metal. Like paint, the layer of other metal prevents water and oxygen from gaining  access to iron. Chromium and  zinc (galvanization) are commonly used for plating iron. You will learn more about electroplating in the next module.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
  
    <li>      Apply oils and  grease to exposed iron. This method is often used on the moving parts of machinery. Oils  and grease repel water because of the lack of polarity in the molecules.      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>You will  address a corrosion problem in the Module 3 Assessment. You might want to view the Module 3 Assessment now and consider which of the four methods listed above  might be applied to the corrosion problem.  You may wish to record any ideas you have so that you can revisit them after you have completed all the lessons in this module and are ready to complete the Module 3 Assessment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will learn more  about other methods to protect iron from corrosion in Module 4. </p>
