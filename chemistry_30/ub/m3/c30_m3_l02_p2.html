<p>The relative reactivity or stability of a metal is determined  empirically. Later in this lesson you will complete an investigation in which you  will observe and interpret the data from many systems of metals and aqueous  solutions of metal ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prepare for the investigation, read page 568 and  the top half of page 569 in the textbook. You will learn about the terms <em>oxidizing agent</em> and <em>reducing agent</em>. These terms are commonly used to discuss  reactants involved in an electrochemical reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evidence of a chemical reaction can take many forms. List observations  that indicate that a chemical reaction has taken place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockB">
  <p><strong>spontaneous:</strong> a process that occurs without any external energy source </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A spontaneous process  will occur on its own.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>non-spontaneous:</strong> a process that is incapable of proceeding unless driven  by an outside source of energy</p>
</div>
<p>When a colour change,  evolution of a gas, formation of a precipitate, or temperature change of a  system is observed, the reaction can be described as <strong>spontaneous</strong>; that is, the  chemical change occurs without a continuous input of energy. If no reaction  evidence is observed, the reaction is <strong>non-spontaneous</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the next investigation you will determine whether the reaction between  various metals and solutions of metal ions is spontaneous or non-spontaneous.<br />
