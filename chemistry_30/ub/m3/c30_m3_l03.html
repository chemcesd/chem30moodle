<p>Electrochemical  reactions involve a transfer of electrons between species. So far in this  module you have learned to identify oxidation, reduction, and agents that bring  about the oxidation and reduction of other substances. In Lesson 2 you wrote half-reactions  for simple changes to the charge of metals and metal ions.  You also used empirical evidence, collected as you completed the investigation &ldquo;Spontaneity of Redox Reactions,&rdquo; to confirm the half-reactions you prepared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  also began using the half-reactions listed on the &ldquo;Table of  Selected Standard Electrode Potentials&rdquo; on page 7 of the Chemistry Data  Booklet. Did you look at some of the other reactions in the table? If so, you may have  noticed that many of the half-reactions involve more than one species. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding  how substances act alone or in combinations to bring about  reactions in a chemical system is an important part of designing chemical systems to achieve a desired function. Chemists and technologists are required  to investigate the behaviour of materials to ensure the materials will not undergo  unwanted side reactions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some situations unexpected side reactions can occur when air, water, or other substances are present in a system.  If their presence was not expected,  an electrochemical reaction could result in the metal's  corrosion, which could lead to metal fatigue and/or to a change in the metal's ability  to function as intended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 3:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How can combinations of species act together as oxidizing or reducing agents?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Can half-reactions be used to predict and explain changes that occur within a chemical system?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Can the same substance be the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent in an electrochemical process?</li>
</ul>

<p>Download a copy of the <a href="c30_m3_l03_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 3:  Lesson 3 Assignment</a>  to your computer now. In this assignment you will develop an experimental  design and complete the data collection and analysis for the lab &ldquo;Testing  Predictions.&rdquo; You will receive further instructions on how to complete this  assignment later in the lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember  that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback that you need  to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all the questions  and place those answers in your course folder. </p>
