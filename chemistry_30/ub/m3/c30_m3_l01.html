<p>Corrosion is a  common sight on metal objects. Often we think of corrosion as the rusting of  iron, but it can also be used to describe the change in other metals, like the  copper in the statue shown in the picture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What colour does the metal copper have? Can you explain  what has happened to the copper in the statue? How could the copper  metal change into copper ions, which appear to wash away from the statue? Is this  an example of a chemical reaction and, if so, what happens when atoms change in  this manner?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The type of change observed here, in which atoms appear to change form and charge, is an important type of change called electrochemical change.  Electrochemical change is the focus of this unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following question as you complete <span class="nowrap">Lesson 1:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is  an electrochemical change?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no  assignment for this lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> There are other questions in this lesson that  are not marked by the teacher; however, you should still answer these  questions. The Self-Check, Try This, and other types of questions are placed in this lesson   to help you review important information and build key concepts that may be   applied in future lessons. You should record the answers to all the questions in   the lesson and place those answers in your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a discussion with your teacher, you must decide what to do with the   questions that are not part of your assignment. For example, you may decide to   submit the responses to Try This and other questions that are not marked to your   teacher for informal assessment and feedback. Your answers are very important to   your teacher. They provide your teacher with information about your learning, and   they help your teacher identify where adjustments to your instruction may be   necessary.</p>
