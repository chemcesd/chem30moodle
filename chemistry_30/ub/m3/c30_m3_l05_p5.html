<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you considered the following questions: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How can a chemical system be analyzed       using redox reactions?</li>
  <li>How is the stoichiometric method       applied to redox systems?</li>
</ul>
<p>An iron filtration  system uses a strong oxidizing agent, permanganate ions, to  oxidize <span class="nowrap">iron(II)</span> ions into a form that allows them to be filtered and removed  from drinking water. The selection of permanganate as a reactant not only  assures a spontaneous and stoichiometric reaction but also allows for  assessment of the system's operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar principles are applied in  the design of a redox titration in which spontaneous and stoichiometric reactions  are used to perform quantitative analysis. Some oxidizing agents  have distinctive colours, like permanganate and dichromate.  As  these substances undergo electrochemical change, their colour change or lack of  change can provide a detectable endpoint for titrations, allowing for accurate  quantitative analysis.</p>
