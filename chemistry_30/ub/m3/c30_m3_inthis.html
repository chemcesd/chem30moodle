<h3 class="unitBh3">Module 3&mdash;Electrochemical Reactions</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Electrochemical Change </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you will observe some chemical reactions in a new way&mdash;as  electrochemical changes. You will learn to write chemical reactions that  demonstrate the kind of change that occurs in these systems, and you will learn how to  interpret these reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is  an electrochemical change?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Predicting Redox Reactions </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you  will analyze sets of data collected from the reaction of metals with aqueous  metal ions to identify patterns in the reactivity of metals and their ions. You  will use these patterns to predict reactions involving other substances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do  some metals appear to react more easily than other metals?</li>
  <li>Is it  possible to predict whether an electrochemical reaction will occur  spontaneously?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Half-Reactions </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you will learn to write and use half-reactions involving more  than one oxidizing or reducing agent. You will use  half-reactions and net ionic equations to explain chemical change in systems in  which the half-reactions for the oxidizing and reducing agents are not provided to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can combinations of species act together as  oxidizing or reducing agents?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Can half-reactions be used to predict and explain  changes that occur within a chemical system?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Can the same substance be the oxidizing agent and  the reducing agent in an electrochemical process?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Oxidation Numbers and Corrosion  Protection </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you  will interpret empirical changes in terms of oxidation states (sometimes as  distinctive as colour changes by certain metal ions) or numbers used to explain  the oxidation or reduction of atoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What  are oxidation numbers, and how can they be used to understand redox reactions?</li>
  <li>What  factors cause corrosion?</li>
  <li>How can  corrosion be prevented?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Redox Stoichiometry</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 5 you  will learn how to adapt your knowledge of redox reactions into designing and  performing quantitative analysis. You will investigate quantitative relationships using a titration experiment  involving oxidizing and reducing agents.  In Module 4 you will extend this to understanding other quantitative measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will investigate the following lesson questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can  a chemical system be analyzed using redox reactions?</li>
  <li>How is  the stoichiometric method applied to redox systems?</li>
  </ul>
