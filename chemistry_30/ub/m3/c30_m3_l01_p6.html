<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you considered the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is  an electrochemical change?</li>
</ul>
<p>By observing the  reaction between zinc and aqueous silver ions you were able to see evidence  of a chemical reaction that can be explained by an electron transfer between  reactants. You also learned how to write, balance, and interpret  half-reactions that describe reduction or oxidation processes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next lesson  you will investigate electrochemical changes involving other metals, and you will conduct an experiment to investigate the difference in the reactivity of selected metals.</p>
