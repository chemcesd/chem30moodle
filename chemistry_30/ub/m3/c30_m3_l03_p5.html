<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you considered the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How can combinations       of species act together as oxidizing or reducing agents?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Can half-reactions be       used to predict and explain changes that occur within a chemical system?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Can the same substance       be the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent in an electrochemical       process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Redox reactions can involve  a variety of substances, which sometimes act in combination to promote the  oxidation or reduction of other substances. You learned that half-reactions can  be used to describe the chemical changes that occur within a system. If provided  with a table of half-reactions written as reductions, you are able to predict  which combinations of substances will react spontaneously.</p>
