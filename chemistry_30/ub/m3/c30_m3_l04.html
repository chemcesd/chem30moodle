<p>Throughout this  module you have considered the reaction of metals with other substances. You  have learned many techniques for interpreting the changes observed in chemical systems undergoing electrochemical change.  You have also learned many new skills, namely the ability to predict the spontaneity of reactions and to explain disproportionation reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many structures  rely on iron for their integrity. For example, reinforced concrete contains rods of steel, which is primarily composed of iron, called rebar.<strong> </strong>The frames of automobiles also rely on iron for their structural  integrity. But we know iron can rust and, when it does, it loses its integrity. In  the Module 3 Big Picture you read about the restoration of the High Level Bridge in Edmonton, Alberta,   and the quantity of corroded material that was removed from the bridge. Since so many  materials rely on iron or steel, corrosion has a great economic impact and  presents serious safety concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 4 you  will investigate the process of corrosion and how it can be further understood  as a redox process. You will also learn about methods that are used to prevent  the corrosion of iron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 4:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What are oxidation numbers and how can       they be used to understand redox reactions?</li>
  <li>What factors cause corrosion?</li>
  <li>How can corrosion be prevented?</li>
</ul>

<p>  Download a copy of  the <a href="c30_m3_l04_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module  3: Lesson 4 Assignment</a>  to your computer now. You will receive further instructions on how to complete  this assignment later in the lesson. The assignment has the following three parts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Part 1: Lab&mdash;Oxidation States of Manganese</li>
  <li>Part 2: Lab&mdash;Corrosion of Nails</li>
  <li>Part 3: Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the  teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback  that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all  the questions and place those answers in your course folder. </p>
