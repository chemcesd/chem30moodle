<p>In previous  chemistry courses you learned about quantitative analysis&mdash;the determination of  the quantity of substance present in a chemical system. Quantitative analysis  is important in all branches of chemistry, design, and engineering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier you  learned that 45 tonnes of rust  were removed in the restoration of Edmonton&rsquo;s High Level   Bridge. Now that you know more about the process of corrosion, you might ask yourself  how many tonnes of iron were oxidized and, therefore, what quantity of metal needed  to be replaced?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many domestic  systems also involve redox reactions. One of these is iron filtration, a commonly  used water treatment method for people who rely on water from a well. In Lesson  5 you will learn about the design and use of iron filtration. You will also further  your understanding of stoichiometry in a quantitative analysis of chemical  systems involving redox reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson 5:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>How can a chemical system be analyzed using redox reactions?</li>
  <li>How is the stoichiometric method applied to redox systems?</li>
</ul>

<p>Download a copy of  the <a href="c30_m3_l05_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module  3: Lesson 5 Assignment</a> to your computer now. You will receive  further instructions on how to complete this assignment later in the lesson.  The assignment has the following parts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Part 1: Lab&mdash;Analyzing a Hydrogen Peroxide Solution</li>
  <li>Part 2: Reflect and Connect</li>
</ul>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the  teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback  that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all  the questions and place those answers in your course folder. </p>
