<p>In 1995, the High Level Bridge  in Edmonton, Alberta,   underwent a major restoration in which approximately 45 tonnes of rusted steel  were replaced, and 100 000 litres of paint were applied. How could so much rust  form? Why was paint applied at the end of the restoration? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look around and you will see many metal objects. Metals are heavily used by society  because of their properties. For example, metals are electrical conductors, are strong, and can be made into different shapes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One negative property of metals is their reactivity.  The performance of metals can be negatively affected when metals undergo chemical change. Metal  performance is an issue in large structures such as bridges and in small  devices that use metals to conduct electric current.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will learn many theoretical concepts in Module 3. It is important that you identify where you are able to use these theoretical concepts to predict and explain your observations and where you are not able to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 4 you will investigate many technological applications of the main theoretical concept of Module 3&mdash;reduction-oxidation reactions. Successfully applying your theoretical knowledge to new situations will help you in Module 4.</p>

<h4><img src="../icons/assignment.gif" alt="" width="36" height="31" /> Assessment in This Module</h4>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>Each lesson contains a range of activities and assessment options. These   include assignments, labs, and Self-Check, Try This, Discuss, Reflect and   Connect, and Reflect on the Big Picture activities. Instructions will be   provided for each of these activities so that you can appropriately focus your   time and effort. Your teacher will tell you which assessment options to complete   and which responses to submit for marks or feedback. Remember to save all of   your work in your Chemistry 30 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Module 3 Assessment you will apply your knowledge of electrochemical change  to describe the  electrochemical basis behind methods of preventing corrosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to look at the Module Assessment and the Unit Assessment before   starting Lesson 1.</p>
