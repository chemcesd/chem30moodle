  </div>
<p>Each metal differs in its ability to react. For example, when exposed to air, pennies (primarily made of copper) tend to  lose their luster. Silver coins and jewelry  tend to tarnish and turn black. Gold, however, does not appear to lose its luster when exposed to air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you learned that the loss of luster in some metals is due to an  electrochemical reaction in which the metals are oxidized and exchange electrons  with another reactant. Knowledge of which metals have the greatest potential to  oxidize, and in what conditions their oxidation is rooted, could be a great  asset when considering materials for use in construction or other  applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you complete Lesson   2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do  some metals appear to react more easily than other metals?</li>
  <li>Is it  possible to predict whether an electrochemical reaction will occur  spontaneously?</li>
  </ul>
<p>The focus of Lesson 2 is on learning how to interpret reaction data that you will collect.  You will also learn  to construct tables that will help you make predictions about the reactivity of metals or metal ions with other substances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to interpret reaction data in the manner you will learn in this lesson is essential to your study in the rest of this unit&mdash;be extra careful as you complete questions and work through problems in this lesson, and ensure you have mastered this skill before moving on to the next lesson.</p>

<p>Download a copy of  the <a href="c30_m3_l02_assign.doc" target="_blank">Module 3: Lesson 2 Assignment</a> to your computer now. You will receive  further instructions on how to complete this assignment later in the lesson.  The assignment has the following parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1:  Lab&mdash;Spontaneity of Redox Reactions</li>
  <li>Part 2:  Lab Exercise 13.A on page 572 of the textbook</li>
</ul>
<p>You must decide what to do with the questions that are not marked by the  teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these questions provide you with the practice and feedback  that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all  the questions and place those answers in your course folder. </p>
