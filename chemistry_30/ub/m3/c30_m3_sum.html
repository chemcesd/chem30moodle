<h3 class="unitBh3">Module 3&mdash;Electrochemical Reactions</h3>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" alt="Summary" width="36" height="32" align="middle" /> Module Summary </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 3 you considered the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What properties of metals make them popular choices  in the construction and production of materials? <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can an understanding of corrosion allow for  better selection of materials and for development of methods that reduce material  damage?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your study of electrochemical change in Module 3 has prepared you to  understand the rationale for many technologies used in products you will  purchase. You also now understand the importance of maintaining  or improving the methods used to protect metals from conditions in which the metals may  react and fail to perform as intended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Concept Map or Graphic Organizer</h6>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>As you worked through Module 3, you may have added information to a concept   map or graphic organizer based on the module and lesson questions listed in the   Module 3 Concept Organizer. Now is a good time to review the relationships in   your concept map or graphic organizer and to try to answer the module and lesson   questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../../images/pdf_files/m3/022_org_chart.pdf" target="_blank">sample Module 3 concept map</a> shows one set of possible links between the   questions. Remember that this is one possible description only&mdash;there are many   other correct possibilities. However, if your completed concept map or graphic   organizer differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your   teacher or to compare your map or organizer with those of other students in your   class. This will ensure that your interpretations of lesson materials and your   descriptions are accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>  <img src="../icons/assignment.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Module Assessment</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider these  photographs:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/m3/001_grainery.jpg" alt="This photograph shows a metal granary surrounded by snow. There is rust on the metal." width="445" height="253" /></p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Describe the electrochemical change that  has discoloured the iron used to construct the granary. Your description must  mention oxidation numbers and include a relevant half-reaction.<br />
    <br /></li>
  
  
  <li>List  technologies that could have been used to prevent this change  from occurring. Select one of the technologies you listed, and prepare a detailed description of how this method prevents this type of change.</li>
  </ol>
      Where possible, use appropriate terminology,  concepts, reaction equations, and diagrams in your response.
 
          
        
  Save your response in your course folder  and submit a copy to your teacher for assessment.
