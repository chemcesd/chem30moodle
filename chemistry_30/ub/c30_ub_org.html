<h5>Module Descriptions </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Module  3&mdash;Electrochemical Reactions </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 3 introduces the  scientific principles associated with reduction-oxidation reactions. You will  learn how redox reactions can be used to analyze and predict changes in a  chemical system, and you will learn how to perform quantitative analysis. This module will  support the work you will do in Module 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will consider the following module questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What properties  of metals make them popular choices in the construction and production of  materials?<br />
  </li>
  <li>How can an  understanding of corrosion allow for better selection of materials and  development of methods that reduce material damage? </li>
</ul>
<h6>Module  4&mdash;Batteries and Balance </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 4 explores how  technologies, like the commercial electric cells you use to operate your cell phone or other electronic devices, involve an application of redox reactions. You  will use your knowledge of electrochemical change to observe, analyze, and  evaluate the design and function of electric and electrolytic cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will consider the following module question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are  principles of oxidation and reduction applied to electrochemical cells?</li>
</ul>
<p>Together these modules  develop your understanding that some types of chemical change involve a  transfer of electrons. In the last unit of this course you will explore  chemical reactions that involve proton transfer reactions. Many of the  principles you will learn in Unit B will apply to your work throughout this  course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Using the Concept Organizer</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each module and lesson contains focusing questions intended to guide your   study. The following concept organizers list the module and lesson   questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../images/pdf_files/m3/022a_org_chart.pdf" target="_blank">Module 3 Concept Organizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="../images/pdf_files/m4/027a_org_chart.pdf" target="_blank">Module 4 Concept Organizer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you work your way through each module, think about how the lesson   questions relate to the module questions and to questions from other lessons.   Use the concept organizers to build a concept map or a graphic organizer for   each module. To do this, you might use software you already have on your   computer, or you might do an Internet search for free software you can use. In   your concept map or graphic organizer, record and demonstrate how the lesson and   module concepts are connected and interdependent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sample concept maps are provided in the Module Summary for each module.   Remember that the samples are just that&mdash;they show only one of many possible   descriptions. However, if your completed concept map or graphic organizer   differs significantly from the sample, you may wish to contact your teacher or   to compare your map or organizer to those of your classmates. This will ensure   that your interpretations of lesson materials and your descriptions are   accurate.</p>
