<p>Unit B focuses on  electrochemical changes in chemical systems. You will explore these concepts by learning the principles involved in  the operation of a technology you probably use every day&mdash;a commercial electric cell, sometimes called a battery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this unit you will look  at chemical systems, and you will investigate them as electrochemical systems&mdash;systems  involving an exchange of electrons. Electrochemical systems are numerous and varied. Electrochemical systems include, for example, biological and non-biological systems and natural and technological  systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 3 introduces the  scientific principles associated with reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. You will  learn how redox reactions can be used to analyze and predict changes in a  chemical system and to perform quantitative analysis. This module will  support the work you will do in Module 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Module 4 explores how  technologies, like the commercial  electric cell, involve an application of redox reactions. You will  use your knowledge of electrochemical change to observe, analyze, and evaluate  the design and function of electric and electrolytic cells. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together these modules develop  your understanding that some types of chemical change involve a transfer of  electrons. In the last unit of this course you will explore chemical reactions  that involve proton transfer reactions. You will apply many of the principles you learn in  Unit B  to your work throughout this course.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of Unit B you  will be able to </p>
<ul>
  <li>explain the  nature of oxidation-reduction reactions</li>
  <li>apply the  principles of oxidation-reduction to electrochemical cells</li>
  <li>analyze  scientific and technological systems that apply electrochemical principles</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Unit  B Assessment you will explore the  scientific and technological aspects of reduction-oxidation reactions, and you will explain and identify their  positive and negative characteristics. </p>
