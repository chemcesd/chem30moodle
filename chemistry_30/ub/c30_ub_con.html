<h3 class="unitBh3">Unit B Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Unit B you investigated  reduction-oxidation reactions, and  you learned about technologies that apply these kinds of reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 3 you learned about the principles involved in electrochemical change. You investigated  the following module questions:    </p>
<ul><li>What properties of metals make them popular choices in the construction and   production of materials? <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can an understanding of corrosion allow for better selection of   materials and development of methods that reduce material damage?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>You interpreted empirical evidence from a variety of chemical systems.  As you completed investigations, you saw evidence of chemical reactions including colour change, formation of gases, and formation of precipitates.  You  learned to use observations to discriminate between spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes and to predict their occurrence using the &quot;Table or Selected Standard Electrode Potentials.&quot; You described the chemical changes you observed using half-reactions and net ionic chemical equations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills enabled you to identify instances in which corrosion of metals occurs, and to predict situations that would encourage the chemical process of corrosion.  Finally, you learned how redox reactions can be used to  perform quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 4 you investigated the following module question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are principles of oxidation and reduction applied to electrochemical cells?</li>
</ul>
<p>You applied the skills you learned in Module 3 to learn about the electrochemical cell. You used your ability to predict and describe electrochemical changes in the design of electric (voltaic) and electrolytic cells, and you used you observation skills and basic chemical tests to confirm the chemical changes observed at the electrodes of these cells.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You continued to advance you understanding of quantitative relationships in electrochemical systems by learning to consider the quantity of electrons as a chemical entity and to perform stoichiometric calculations involving current, time, and moles of chemical substances. Finally, you learned about other types of electrochemical cells (including fuel cells and electrolytic cells) and their application as technologies used by society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>explain the nature of oxidation-reduction reactions</li>
  <li>apply the principles of oxidation-reduction to electrochemical cells</li>
  <li>analyze scientific and technological systems that apply electrochemical principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Your study of  electrochemical changes is an important part of understanding chemical change,  a central theme of Chemistry 30. In unit D you will be introduced to the concept  of proton-transfer reactions. In Unit D and as a result of your learning in Unit B, you will be  able to apply many  principles into another area of chemistry&mdash;chemical equilibrium.</p>

  Complete the <a href="c30_ub_con_001.html" target="_blank">Unit B Diagnostic Self-Check</a> to review the concepts, skills, and knowledge introduced and to assess your understanding of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have trouble answering any of the questions, try one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the lesson(s) indicated for each question. Once there,  review the information provided and the relevant sections of the textbook.
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>View the hint associated with each question.
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>Look at the answer and then work backward to understand the problem and its solution.
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>Ask your teacher for help.</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand how important it is to review material in preparation for any tests your teacher may give you and in solidifying your understanding of new concepts. Completing these questions is just one part of your review. Program of Studies information is associated with each question. You may wish to use this information to identify areas in which you need to pay particular attention. You may also  answer the questions that appear at the end of each chapter and unit in the textbook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have already reviewed your Modules 3 and 4 concept maps or graphic organizers. Now is a good time to give them another look and add any new connections or ideas to them.<br />
